TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

Strabo from the similarity of its ramifications to a stag's horn) had
already in his time the name of the Golden Horn, from the wealth
flowing into it.

Pontum erumpens : cf. ⁴ erumpere nubem ' Verg. Aen. i 580.

ξ 3. quaestuosi, &c., ‘this was originally the source of their traffic
and wealth.'1n xiii 35, ‘nitidi et quaestuosi ’ = luxurious and
profit· mongers, eager trad3.ers

finem aut modum, ‘remission or abatement'.

Thraecio, διε. The Bosporan war is that of which the later part
is related in chs. 15—21. The‘ Thracian war ³ probably refers to
some hostilities which occurred at the time when Thrace became a
province, in 46 A. D.

Chapter 64, ξ 1. M. Asinius Marcellus, great· grandson of
Asinius Pollio, Augustus' contemporary, is mentioned again in xiv
40 as one of the accomplices in a case of the forgery of a will m
61 A. D. ; although guilty, he was excused punishment on the score
of his noble descent and at Nero’s intercession.

M’. Acilius: subsequently proconsul of Asia, 65-66 A. D.,
probably son of the Acilius Aviola mentioned in iii 41, who as
legatus of Gallia Lugdunensis was active in the suppression of the
first beginnings of the revolt in Gaul instigated by Sacrovir and
Florus, in 21 A. D.

igne caelesti: lightning, or the phenomenon called St. Elmo's
fire. ·
fastigio, ‘on the pediment ’. The accus. is usually found with
the verb ‘ insido ³, in Tacitus; the dative however is supported by
Verg. Aen. vi 708 ‘floribus insidunt’.

ξ 2. biformes, ‘monstrous’‚ whether referring to duplication of
organs, or to half—human, half-bestial forms.

editum: the change to indirect speech is very abrupt. The
reading of Med. ‘ediditum ¹ may be a corruption for ‘ editum esse
creditum ’, or a verb such as ‘memorabant ' has dropped out before

‘ numerabatur ’.
3. defunctis: none of these are known ; the consul must have

been a ‘sssuffectus as both those given above are known to have
been living after.

ξ 4. vocem: Suet. (Cl. 43) adds that other expressions led
Agrippina to sear that Claudius meant to restore Britannicus to the
position from which he had been ousted in favour of Nero.

Domitia Lepida: cf. xi 37, 4.

minore ε the same mistake hasbeen made here as in iv 44. She
was really daughter of the elder Antonia.

avunculo, ‘ great-uncle ’. The construction is abl. abs.

sobrina prior, ‘ first cousin once removed ’. Domitia was grand-
daughter of Octavia, sister of Augustus ; Agrippina was Augustus’
great-granddaughter.

Gnaei: Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, father of Nero; cf. vi
1, 1.

ξ 5. quam: supply ‘ eis’ before ‘si qua '.
