8 (a) [15]. After compound verbs expressing deprivation, Tacitus
follows poets and Livy in using a dative, rather than ablative with
a preposition : extrahere, vi 23, 5 ; eximere, vi 9, 6.

(b) [21]- After compound verbs, Tacitus follows poets in
using a dative rather than ad or in with the accusative: penatibus
induxerit, v 1, 3 ; indicibus accessere, vi 7, 5.

9 [19]. The dative of a noun, so closely connected with another
that a genitive would be expected, is frequent in poets and Livy,
and still more so in Tacitus : ministri sceleribus, vi 36, 4 ; corpori
custodes, ibid. ; rex Hiberis, xi 8, 2.

ιο [18]. The Dative of Agent is used without restriction to the
gerundive or adjectives in -bilis, and without any prominence of
the idea of the ‘interest’ of the agent: possessa C'yro, vi 31, 2;
mihi narratus, xi 29, 1 ; cui pars provinciae habebatur, xii 54, 3:
most of such expressions should be referred to this case rather
than ablative, as Macedonibus sitae, vi 41, 2; audita scriptaque
senioribus, xi 27, 2 ; quis . . . ultio . . . timebatur, xii 9, 2.

11 [22]. The Dative of Purpose or Work contemplated is very
frequent, the gerund or gerundive in this case following a parti-
ciple or a verb, in the sense of a final clause: componendis
patrum actis delectus, v 4, 1 3 reciperandaeque Armeniae Hiberum
Mithridaten deligit, vi 32, 53 quibus abluendis . . . egrediens, xi
2, 4; dissimulando metu digrediuntur, xi 32, 1; so also, xi 1, 1;
xii 66, 1, and many other passages,

Sometimes it follows adjectives : accipiendis suspicionibus promp-
tior, xii 4, 3 ; facilis capessendis inimicitiis, v 11, 1.

A noun may be used in this way: custodiae eius imponit, xii
41, 83 excubiis adest, xii 69, 1 ; diem locumque foederi accepit, xii
46, 6; coniugio accepit, vi 20, 1.

12 [23]. This should be distinguished from ‘ predicative ’ datives,
showing that which a thing or person serves'as or occasions, such
as rubori, xi 17, 33 ostentui. . . dehonestamento, xii 14, 6 ; remedio
quaesita, vi 17, 3; curae, vi 22, 23 exitio, xi 24, 5. In xi 14, 5
usui stands, in an unusual manner, attributively.
