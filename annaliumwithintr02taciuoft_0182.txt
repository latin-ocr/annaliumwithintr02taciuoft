48 B.C. the interest paid‚ or in armar, was struck off from the
principal, and creditors had to take in lieu of payment the real and
persona] property of the debtor, estimated at what it had been
worth before the Civil War. This was a temporary measure, and
there was also a permanent law, imperfectly known to us, limiting
the amount of money that might be legally held in private hands or
loaned (‘ de modo credendi possidendique intra Italiam ’.) Its regu-
lations doubtless aimed at forcing capitalists to place out on loan or
invest a certain amount of their property, and probably required
a definite proportion to be invested in Italian land, so as to en-
courage expenditure of capital on the soil and by giving capitalists
a stake in the country to discourage mere money- -lending.
