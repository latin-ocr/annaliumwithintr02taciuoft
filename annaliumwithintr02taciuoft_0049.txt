TIBERIUS

procured by disgraceful means against 'l'itus Sabinus (iv 69) 3 con-
fiscation for the benefit os the exchequer was enforced (iv 20);
informers had their rewards assured to thern even when the accused
anticipated condemnation by suicide (iv 30). Towards the close of
this period, t00, began the ominous dispatches from the emperor at
Capreae (iv 70); the emperor's absence from Rome became per-
manent, and the evils prevalent became intensified, with Seianus in
charge at Rome and working upon his master’s timidity to further
his own ends. And so we find that the house of Germanicus has
now fallen into danger of destruction, though at the beginning of
this period it was still in favour (iv 8).

The last stage opens with the death of Livia Augusta, whom
Tacitus at this point represents as having afforded protection to
the house of Germanicus against the murderous plots of Seianus, in
spite of previous insinuations that she was the ‘terrible step-mother,'
to blame for all the deaths that had occurred in the house of the
Caesars. Now, however, her death is said to remove the restraint
upon Tiberius' resentment against Agrippina and her sons; and
Tiberius and Seianus in consequence immediately effect the banish-
ment of Agrippina and Nero, and a year later Drusus is imprisoned
also. But Seianus’ influence still had its limits 3 Agrippina's third
son, Gaius, was in Tiberius’ favour, and was regarded as his heir,
and Nero survived two years more. Seianus was not permitted to
make the hoped-sor marriage which would have united him to the
imperial family, and was not associated in the tribunician power.
Soon Tiberius, ever prone to suspicion, when other grounds sor it
were removed, turned against his minister, and Seianus was de-
stroyed as guilty of plotting against the emperor and Gaius. It is
not certain whether this plot really existed: it seems inherently
probable from what we know of the character and career of Seianus ;
but though its existence was believed in by Tacitus and Suetonius,
and it is related as a fact by Josephus, it does not appear to have
been formally proved in the Senate which condemned him, and the
account in Dio suggests that no conspiracy was ever matured ¹.

In Tacitus' account, at the beginning of Book vi, os the events
following the downfall of Seianus, we read of a very reign os terror.
