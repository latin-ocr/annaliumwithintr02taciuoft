58 [80]. Ellipses have already been noticed, in the case of
verbs, §27‚ prepositions, ἓξ 5, 8, 13, 14, 19, and other particles, ξ 48.
Observe also the omission of annus, xi 11, 1 ; filia, xii 1, 3, and
the curious conciseness of expression in xii 18, 3. See also vi 26, 3.

59 [82]. Parenthetical remarks are sometimes introduced con—
cisely by a word apparently in apposition in the nominative, and
equivalent to a relative clause: rarum, vi 10, 3; incertum an . . .,
xi 22, 2 (like δῆλον ὅτι). This use is to be distinguished from that in
§6 a. A pure parenthesis may be seen in xii 42, 4.

60 [83]. Zeugma, or the reference to two objects os a verb strictly
applicable only to the nearest, is common in Tacitus: see the use
of fore, vi 21, 5; nequibat, xii 64, 6; peritus, xi 29, 2. In vi 24, 3,
quemadmodum nurum filiumque fratris et nepotes domumque
omnem caedibus complevisset, ‘ necasset ’ must be supplied with
the first group of objects. Verbs also are used with two objects in
different senses, by ‘syllepsis’: struere, xi 12, 1 ; moliri, xii 22, 1 ;
intentare, xii 47, 5. So, too, a masculine noun may be applied to
persons of both sexes: pronepotes, v 1, 4; filii, xi 38, 33 fratres,
xii 4, 2.

61 [84]. ‘ Pregnant ' constructions may be seen in xii 18, 3
(quoted above, ξ 58) ; and in the use of infantiam, xi 34, 1 ; gratia,
xii 7, 43 Chaldaeos, xii 22, 1 ; maiora, xii 9, 1.

IV. INFLUENCE or THE STUDv or VAR1ETv.

62 [85]. The form of words is varied 3 thus, Eastern names vary
in declension‚ as Artaxata, which is sometimes fem. sing„ some-
times neut. plur.; so also Tigranocerta3 Vologeses is sometimes
Vologesus.

Similarly, Tacitus uses both alioqui and alioquin; balneae and
balneum ; dein and deinde ; grates and gratias agere 3 inermis and
inermus; senecta and senectus, ἃς.

63 [86]. Names often mentioned are varied ; either by inversion
of usual order, as Scauro Mamerco, vi 9, 5, or by use osone part of
