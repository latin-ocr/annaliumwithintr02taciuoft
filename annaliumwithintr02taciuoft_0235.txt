He was an enemy of Tiberius and intrigued against him, en-
couraging Gaius Caesar in opposition when Tiberius was under
a cloud. Pliny and Velleius describe him unfavourably3 Horace
eulogizes him, Od. iv 9, 34—44. He committed suicide on losing
Gaius’ favour. For Lollia's subsequent history see ch. 22.

Agrippina: see note on ch. 2, 3.

Aelia Paetina had already been married to Claudius, and had
been divorced, after the birth of a daughter, Antonia (ch. 2, 1).

Tuberonum: the most famous of these was the jurist Q. Aelius
Tubero, possibly her grandfather.

Narcisso: dat. Cf. Intr. Il 10.

ξ 4. promptus: inclined to favour. Cf. iv 60, 5 ‘ mater Agrippina
promptior Neroni erat ’. [This Nero was son of Germanicus, not
the emperor]

nihil . . . novum, ‘the absence of any change ' ; cf. iii 9, 3
‘ celebritate loci nihil occultum’ and Intr. 11 2.

proxima suis: next to her own, in affection.

pignora, ‘pledges of affection ’‚ a word common in Augustan
poets, and adopted by Tacitus to express children, or near relatives ;
cf. xv 17, 3 and Germ. vii 4.

dignum, δια, ‘fully worthy of imperial position’; Pallas does
not mean to recommend him as successor to Claudius, -but as
worthy to be an adopted member of his family.

stirpem, &c., ‘ let him unite to himself a noble race, the posterity
of the Julii and the Claudii ’.

‘ Et . . . posteros ’ is explanatory of ‘stirpem nobilem ''‚ and refers
to the lineage of Agrippina and her son. She was of the Julian
house, on her mother's side, and of the Claudian house, on her
father’s side. See Genealogical Tree, Intr. p. lxv.

[The reading of Med„ ‘ et familiae Claudiae quae posteros coniun-
geret '‚ might perhaps mean, ‘ Her offspring (viz. Nero) was a noble
one, and (a scion) of the house of Claudius, and would be a bond
uniting their (Claudius’ and Agrippina's possible) issue’ ; i.e. Nero
would remain in Claudius' family, and be merely one of his possible
new children; he would help to keep the imperial family together,
by being adopted by the emperor instead of remaining outside.
The argument is of course far-fetched and unnatural.——H. Ρ.]
