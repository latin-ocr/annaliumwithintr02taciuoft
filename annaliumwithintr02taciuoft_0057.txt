sight of the imperfections in his system of governmcnt or os the
abuses to which his defects os character gave risc. There was a
sinister aspect in the methocl of his elevation to the position of
princeps; he was a ruler imposed upon the state by the choico
of the soldiers; and this military ‘praerogativa‚' to which the
ratification of the Senate came second, was rewarded with lavish
gists to the troops. By a similar procedure Agrippina, at Claudius’
death, was enabled to set her son on the throne, in spite of
Britannicus’ better right; the precedent had been set for what
in later times proved so terrible an abuse, the aequirement of the
imperial throne by purchase from the legions.

The intention, professed by Claudius, to restore the constitution
as it had been under Augustus, when government was shared
between the Senate and the princeps, was not actually realized,
and was perhaps owing to the conditions of the time not practi-
cable. For the past fen years, through the closing part of
Tiberius‘ reign and the rule of Gaius, the Senate had been
oppressed and intimidated: it was now reduced in numbers and its
energies were impaired‚ so that it was not capable of resuming
an effective grasp of public administration. We do not hence-
forward find the Senate making provision for current emergencies
or new spheres of administration3 rather than this, the emperor
selects new ministers directly responsible to himself, srorn among
the equites or the imperial freedmen, and his ‘procuratores’ are
found in charge of new departments at home, and enjoy increased
power and independence throughout the empire. Such a system
might have worked satisfactorily enough under a ruler of strong
character and practical ability. But Claudius was lacking in these
qualities. In his early life he had had no such administrative
training as had fallen to Augustus and Tiberius; till middle life
his occupations, at best, had been those of the recluse and
student. Nor was his learning worn ‘lightly, like a flower‚' but
it made him diffuse and pedantic, unable to see facts in their true
proportion, prone to give rambling and sar-fetched reasons for
his opinions, and to make much of fanciful ‘reforms‚' such as the
introduction of new letters or the revival of ancient methods of
spelling. Vanity of this sort, coupled with the desire to show

himself like Augustus, led him to interfere to excess in judicial
