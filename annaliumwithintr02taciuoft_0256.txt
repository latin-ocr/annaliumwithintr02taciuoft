TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

ξ 5. rudes et informes saxorum compages: cf. Intr. II 57, b.

par' comminus acies, ‘the lines met close together on equal
ternis .

decedere, ‘lest their position ². (The word often indicates the
depa)rture of a provincial governor from his sphere of administra-
tion.

§6. ferentarius: the auxiliaries, just as ‘gravis miles’ means
the legionaries. The word is applied, according to Varro, to
‘ equites . . . qui ea modo habebant arma quae ferrentur, ut
iaculum ². Vegetius speaks of foot-soldiers so called, ‘ apud veteres’‚
who were light-armed and stationed with the slingers on the wings,
and opened the battle by skirrnishing. The word is used, in a
figure, by Plautus, and occurs in Sallust, probably as an archaism.
As such, Tacitus seems to have adopted it from Sallust.

conferto gradu, ‘ in close order '.

resisterent . . . verterent ε frequentative, as in ch. 32, 2
‘ temptarent ’.

spathis: ‘gravis armatura . . . habebant . . . gladios maiores,
quos spathas vocant‘ ; Vegetius.

36 Chapter 36, ξ 1. ut, &c., ‘as adversity generally brings in-
securit ’.

110Πέ post anno, &c. ε 51 A. D., reckoning inclusively from 43 A. D.

ξ 2. unde: i. e. from this prolonged resistance.

evecta insulas: so ‘ evadere’ (ch. 35, 3) and ‘ egredi ' (i 30, 2)
are followed by accusative in Tacitus.

insulas: naturally plural, as a Roman would think of Ireland,
⁴ Mona ’, ‘ Vectis ', and the islands north and west of Scotland as
forming one group with Britain.

quis ille = ‘quis ille esset qui . . . ’; cf. xi 7, 1.

ζ» 4. in armis: usually, in the city, the soldiers were ‘togati’
(Hz'st. i 38, 5).

eampo: Intr. II 14.

castra: the praetorian camp. (Instituted by Seianus, 23 A. D.)

praeiacet: with accus. 3 cf. ⁴ praesidere ’, ch. 14, 7 ; ‘praeminere ⁵,
ch. 12, 1.

ξ 5. phalerae: plates or bosses of chased inetal worn on the
breast.

torques: a specially Celtic ornament.

externis: from the Roman point of vieW‚ ‘in British wars’.

traducta, ‘ were led in procession ’.

§6. degeneres: cf. ch. 19, 1.

at non: the negative belongs only to ‘ aut . . . aut ’.

in huno modum. The speech is probably Tacitus’ composition.
It is hardly likely that Caratacus knew enough Latin to deliver a
public address. On the other hand, it is not impossible that he
should have learnt a speech by rote, for this ceremony.

37 Chapter 37,§ 1. fortuna, ‘rank ’ ; cf. ch. 19, 2.

rerum prosperarum moderatio, ‘ moderate use of’, ‘humility
in, prosperity’.
