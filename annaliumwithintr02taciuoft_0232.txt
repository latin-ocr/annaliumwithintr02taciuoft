TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

Chapter 34, ξ 2. instabat, ἃς, ‘ was pressing him to explain
his ambiguity‚ and permit thein to know his real meaning ’. For
the construction cf. ⁴ hortantur (ine) uti ’‚ xi 24, 1 and Intr.
ΙΙ 31. ·

non ideo, ‘for all that, he did not'‚ &e

non pervicit quin: an unusual phrase; but Livy has ‘ nec . . .
valuit quin ³, iv 44, 2.

suspensa, &c., ⁴ hesitating expressions, capable of bearing
whatever meaning was assigned to thern ’ ; cf. ‘ in crimen duci ’, ‘to
be distorted into a ground of accusation ², vi 5, 2.

ξ 3. eum obstrepere: sor historic infin. aster a conjunction
see Intr. II 34.

with Antonia, Claudius’ daughter by Paetina, xii 2, 1.

offerebantur, nisi iussisset: Intr. II 38.

ξ 5. invidia, ‘reproachful language’ ; cf. xv 19, 2 ‘magna curn
invidia senatum adeunt '.

Chapter 35, ξ 1. ignaro propior, ‘resembled one unconscious '.

ξ 2. patris: cf. ch. 12. His trial for ‘ maiestas'‚ and condemna-
tion⁷ is recounted in iv 18—20‚ but nothing is there said of any
decree ordering the destruction of his statues.

Statues of condemned ancestors were usually not shown in
funeral processions, but it was a measure of rather unusual severity
to prohibit their possession within doors. .

quidquid, &c.‚ ‘how all the heirlooms of the Nerones and Drusi
had gone to swell the reward of infamy’. Cf. ‘in pretium belli
cessurae ⁹, Hz'st. i 11, 4. The names of Nero and Drusus are thus
coupled to denote the union, in the reigning house, of the families of
the Claudii Nerones and the Livii Drusi3 see v 1, 1.

ξ 3. praemonente Narcisso, ‘after a prelirninary admonition
from Narcissus ', addressed to the soldiers. Cf. xii 69, 1 ‘ monente
praefecto '. For the tense cf. Intr. ΙΙ 42.

etsi: to be taken closely with ‘iustum ’, like ‘quamvis ’. ‘ Nam ’
explains ‘ pauca ’.

ξ· 4. tribunali: the seat of judgment, one of ‘the features of the
officers’ quarters (‘ principia ⁹) in the camp.

ἦ 5. inlustres equites: see vi 18, 4; xi 4, Ι.

§6 The names cited in this section are perhaps those of the
‘equites’ just mentioned, although Proculus could not have been
said to show the same ‘ constantia' as Silius. Vettius Valens
is mentioned in ch. 30, and a ‘ Helvius ' (not ‘ Saufeius') Trogus in
Seneca, Lud. xiii 4; otherwise these persons are unknown.

custodem: husband and wife sometimes assigned a ‘ custos ’ to
each other, to ensure fidelity. ‘Custodes das, Polla, viro, non
accipis ipsa’, Mart. x 69, 1. ‘Quis custodiat ipsos custodes’?

uv. vi 347.
J indicium offerentem: he hoped by this means to secure his own
acquittal. Cf. vi 3, 5.
iubet: supply ‘ Claudius' as subject.
