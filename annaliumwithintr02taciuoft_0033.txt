STY LE

Tacitus for such events as accusation, banishment‚ suicide, death,
will be readily noticed on reading the text.

V. INFLUENCE oF ΙΜιΤΑΤιΟΝ.

66 [95]. The Graecisms in Tacitus are chiefly such as had already
become naturalized in Latin, and most have been noticed in previous
paragraphs. To these may be added immunire, Ξἐντειχίζειν, xi 19,
1 ; quae . . . revincebatur, vi 5, 2, where the passive may be
regarded as equivalent to a middle voice: et alia clarum, = τά τε
ἄλλα λαμπρόν, xii 3, 2.

67 [96]. Some archaic usages are affected, as potiri with accusa-
tive, xi 10, 8; dissertare, xii 11, 1.

68 [97]. The debt of Tacitus to his chief predecessors in historical
writing and to the great classical poets may be illustrated here by
a few instances; others can be gathered from previous sections
(e. g. 26 b), and many are pointed out in the notes on the text.
