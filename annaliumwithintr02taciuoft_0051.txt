TIBERIUS

lntrinsically, it is most improbable that a man os seventy should.
aster a lise os austerity and sels-control‚ente1· upon a course os gross
and unnatural sensuality, and prolong his lise in spite os it to the
age of nearly seventy—eight. While there is no positive evidence
available sor the refutation os these charges, they are, however,
distinctly ‘ not proven '; and inasmuch as they are os just the kind
that ancient malice would invent against an unpopular person living
in close retirement, it is only fair to give Tiberius the benefit os the
doubt in the matter.

It remains to offer some explanation of the cause of Tacitus'
uncompromising hostility to Tiberius. It seems partly accountable
by the fact that Tacitus’ political sympathies were with the ‘noble’
opposition to the principate at its inception3 he regarded the old
days of republican ‘liberty’ as representing a higher condition of
political life, and could not help viewing the founders of the empire
as the destroyers of a constitution that represented a more exalted
ideal. Moreover, into his view of Tiberius there probably entered
a considerable amount of the traditional ill-feeling entertained by the
other ‘nobiles' against the house of the Claudii, whose political
conduct had often run counter to noble interests and whose inde-
pendence, in fact, was characterized by their peers as arrogance.

Then Tacitus no doubt read the times of Tiberius very much in
the light of his experience of Domitian's rule, and saw, or fancied
he saw, prevalent under Tiberius the abuses that reached their
height under Domitian, a reign of terror owing to the unchecked
iniquities of the informers and the abject servility of the Senate.
Nor had Tiberius the qualities shown by Trajan, the emperor
whose rule was so welcomed by Tacitus in contrast to all the
oppression of Domitian. Trajan was a great conqueror, whose
armies advanced beyond the Danube and the Euphrates, whereas
Tiberius shrank timidly behind the frontiers bequeathed to him.
Trajan's vast operations in engineering and building were in strong
contrast to the parsimony that checked Tiberius srorn any such
beneficent expenditure (vi 45, 2). And so Tiberius won no credit
with Tacitus for the sound, though less dazzling, features of his
administration‚ of which there is no doubt,—-the preservation of
peace and the equitable regulation of the provinces. This side of
Tiberius’ government must not be forgotten. Cruelty and extortion
