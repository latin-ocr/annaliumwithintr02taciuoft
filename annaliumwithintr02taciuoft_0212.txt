Chapter 11, ξ 1. Isdem consulibus: Claudius and Vitellius,
the consuls of the year, 47 A. D., are meant, though they had by this
time probably given place to ‘ suffecti '‚ and had themselves entered
on their censorship (ch. 13, 1).

ludi saeculares: these were now held by Claudius to mark the
seventh centenary of the traditional date of the foundation of Rome
(753 B.c.), but they had been instituted by Augustus in 17 B.C. to
mark a ‘saeculum ' of a different sort, namely the inauguration of
a ‘new age ⁹, which, according to a tradition partly Greek partly
Etruscan, opened upon the expiration of four great periods of 110
years (see below, on ‘ rationes ³).

The ceremonies of this festival were modelled on the ‘ ludi
Terentini ’ believed to be of great antiquity and regular recurrence, of
which however the earliest authenticated celebration took place in
249 B.C. (Varro ap. Censorinum), when, on the occurrence of a great
number of unfavourable prodigies, ‘ ludi Terentini in campo Martio ’
were ordered in honour of Dis and Proserpina, with sacrifices of
‘ hostiae furvae ', and their repetition ‘ centesimo quoque anno ' was
enjoined, The festival had been repeated in 146 B.C., but its next
centenary lapsed as it fell in the time of the civil war of Pompeius
and Julius Caesar. The ‘ludi Terentini ’ were not originally a
Roman festival, and the gods honoured were not Roman ; hence its
celebration outside the ‘pomerium'; but Augustus' festival included
sacrifices to the Roman state divinities‚ Jupiter, Juno Lucina, Apollo,
Diana, and Latona, as well as to Demeter, the Fates, Dis, and
Proser ina.

quai-io et sexagensimo: sc.‘ anno ⁹ ; 17 B. C. marked the expira-
tion of the first decade of Augustus' rule, when the ‘imperium ’ con-
ferred on him in 27 Β. C. was renewed for five years more.
