INTRODL'CTION

Tiberius was never weary of accusations and executions; men
perished sor old offences as well as recent oneS, for words as well
as deed53 a very plague of ‘delation’ broke out; an ‘immensa
strages‚‘ of all who were accused of complicity with Seianus, was
perpetrated (vi 19, 3). A closer view shows that such a description
exaggerates the facts. There are cases still of pardon and acquittal
(vi 5, 2; 9, 1 ; 7, 1¹); some escape by giving information (vi 3, 53
7, 5), others by adjournment or by being ignored (vi 9, 7 ; 14, 4) ;
others receive a less sentence than death (vi 3, 3; 18, 2·3), and
amid the horrors of the time prudent men, such as Μ’. Lepidus,
L. Piso, Aelius Lamia, Poppaeus Sabinus, can still hold their own
in honour (vi 27, 43 10, 3; 27, 2; 39, 3). Of course, even after
such deduction is made, there is still a long list of victims, amount-
ing to some forty in number, and there must have been many others
whose destruction was narrated in the lost part of the Annals. The
‘immensa strages ’ of vi 19, 3 may refer to the execution of twenty
in one day as reported in Suetonius (Tib. 61). But when all allow-
ance is made, not less than eighty persons must have perished in
the last six years of Tiberius' reign, and for most of these deaths the
emperor was responsible, though at the end they were directly
brought about by Macro acting in his master’s name.

Some of these victims would be creatures of Seianus, and, if his
conspiracy was a fact, would be guilty of complicity with him, and
were justly executed3 but there were circumstances of horrible
cruelty in the execution of Seianus' children and the old mother of
Fufius Geminus (vi 10, 1), and in the accusation of the descendants
of Theophanes (vi 18, 5,). Finally, in regard to the closing years of
Tiberius' life, both Tacitus and Suetonius charge him with the
constant practice of abominable sensuality in his retirement at
Capreae. The references to Tiberius in earlier authors, as Philo,
Josephus, Seneca, and the elder Pliny, do not offer any confirmation
of these charges3 even Juvenal, who, one might suppose, would
take up such a subject with avidity, represents his companions at
Capreae as no worse than astrologers (x 93), and even in Tacitus’
description of the emperor‘s retinue when he set forth from Rome
to Capreae there is no indication that he is preparing to retire to
scenes of vicious sels-indulgence3 his attendants are chiefly Greek
men of letters, chosen for their interesting conversation (iv 58).
