INTRODUCTION

and went into retirement at Rhodes, in 6 B. C., persisting in this
determination even against the express wish of Augustus, who
wanted him to undertake the settlement of the Eastern provinces,
where the disturbances in Armenia were a danger to the con-
tinuance of peace. His refusal brought upon him the displeasure
of Augustus, and when the tribunician power which he had received
sor five years expired, his position was by no means safe, and his
retirement came to amount very nearly to banishment. He obtained
leave to return to Rome in 2 A. D., but continued in seclusion until
the death of Gaius Caesar in 4 A. D. Then, Lucius Caesar being
already dead, Tiberius was admitted once more to the emperor's
favour3 he was now adopted into the family of the Caesars, was
associated with Augustus in the ‘tribunicia potestas‚’ and was dis-
played as the heir before the greatest armies of the state (i 3, 3).
'A second period of military activity now ensued. Tiberius con·
ducted campaigns in Germany in 4 and 5 A. D., then he had to deal
with the great rebellion which broke out in Pannonia in 6 A. D., and
he remained in that country until the disaster suffered by Varus in
Germany in 9 A. D. required his presence there. He then reor-
ganized the army acting in defence of the Rhine frontier, in 10 A.D.,
and advanced into Germany in 11 A. D., re-establishing order, and
finally returning to Rome for a triumph in the following year. He
was then rewarded with a renewal of the ‘tribunicia potestas‚’ and
was further associated with the emperor in his ‘proconsulare im-
perium.' At the tirne of Augustus’ last illness he had set forth for
the Illyrian province, whence he returned to succeed to the
principate.

At the time of his accession Tiberius was in his fifty-sixth year.
The events of his life so far, alternating between military activity
and retirement, high honour and obscurity, and bringing bereave-
ment and disappointment, left him austere and resewed, prone to
take a cynica] view of society and to set small store on the deference
now paid him. A sentence in Tacitus (i 80, 3), that his penetration
was keen but his resolution weak, seems to be borne out by the
facts, and this mixture of weakness and strength, clear insight
coupled with irresolution in action, affords the key to much of the
conduct of the new ruler.
