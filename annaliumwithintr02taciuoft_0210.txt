TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

Chapter 8, ξ 1. Sub idem tempus: loosely expressed, since
the date of the return of Mithridates, determined by the contem-
porary Parthian history (see below) and by that of Vibius Marsus
(see note on ch. 10, 1), can hardly have been later than
43 A.D.

Mithridates: this prince had become king of Armenia by the
aid of Tiberius; see vi 32, 5.

memoravi: in the lost part of the Ammls dealing with the times
of Gaius.

Vinctum: So Dio, ὃν ὁ Γάϊος μεταπεμψάμενος ἐδεδέκει (lx 8, 1).
During this period Armenia had fallen under Parthian in-
fluence.

Pharasmanis: see vi 32, 5.

§ 2. Hiberis: see vi 32‚5 3 and for the case see Intr. ΙΙ 9.

summa, &c.‚ ‘ the throne itself was in dispute 3 whatever was less
important was treated carelessly ’.

ξ 3. Gotarzes, son of the Parthian king Artabanus III 3 see vi 31,
1 and Intr. VI, p. lx.

Vardanes was another son of Artabanus III.

ξ 4. ausis: substantivaL a Vergilian use.

biduo tria milia stadiorum: i.e. nearly 350 English miles in
48 hours, a rate of progress impossible sor a whole army even if
consisting of horsemen. If he came with a few followers. and by
relays of horses, the rate is the same as that of Hannibal from
Zama to Adrumetum (App. Fun. 47), and less than that of Tiberius
when travelling to his brother Drusus (Pl. N. H. vii. 20, 84).

invadit, ⁴ traverses ⁹, ‘covers ³.

praefecturas, ‘ provinces’; cf. 10, 1 ; vi 42, 5. These are the
great viceroyalties of the Parthian Empire (eighteen in number
according to Pliny 1na.)‚ corresponding somewhat to the satrapies
of the Persian Empire. The viceroys were called βίστιικες or
‘ vitaxae ². ⁴ Praefectura ’ is also used of the military subdivisions of
Armenia, xiii 37, 2.

Seleucenses: Seleucia on the Tigris; see vi 42, 1.

§5. defectores: cf. Intr. II 51, a.

ira magis, &c.‚ ‘inflamed with anger rather than proceeding
according to the immediate needs of the case '. Cf. 7, 2.

ξ 6. The Dahae and Hyrcani were Scythic races, south-east and
east of the Caspian. See vi 36, 5.

Bactria: between the Upper Amoo (Oxus) and the Hindoo Koosh
(Paropamisus); after the fall of its Greek dynasty its possession was
disputed between Parthians and Scythians.

Chapter 9, ξ 1. Tunc: the narrative of the events of Armenia
is resumed from ch. 8, Ι.

incertis: not ‘hesitating’, but = ‘de quibus incertum erat’3
cf. Livy xxx 35, 9 ‘Italicos, incertos socii an hostes essent, in
postremam aciem summotos ’.

So xiii 19, Ι ‘ nemo adire praeter paucas feminas, amore an odio
incertas '
