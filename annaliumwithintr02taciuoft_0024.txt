INTRODUCTION

6, 2; vi 50, 53 ferre for proferre, vi 49, 3; xii 4, 1; venire for
evenire, xii 32, 4 ; vertere (probably) for evertere, xii 45, 5.

29 [41]. Verbs, usually transitive, are found used intransitively:
vertere, vi 19, 13 46, 3 (so also, of things, in Livy, Sallust and
Caesar); mutare, xii 29, 1 ; agere, xi 16, 4 ; agitare, xi 21, 2.

30 [42]. intransitive verbs are found used personally, in the
passive, as in poetry: triumphari, xii 19, 4.

IV. Moons AND TENSES.
A. Infinitive.

31 [43]. Verbs of commanding, entreating, advising, and those
which express effort and compulsion, which in earlier classical prose
are usually followed by ‘ ut ' or ‘ ne ’ with the subjunctive, are used in
great numbers by Tacitus with an infinitive clause completing their
sense ε admonuit C. Cestium patrem dicere, vi 7, 33 Vibidiam . . .
oravit . . . adire, xi 32, 5 3 hortatur . . . capessere, xi 16, 3; impule-
rat uxorem suam iuvenem inlicere, vi 45, 53 inducunt sententiam
expromere, xii 9, 1; perpulit . . . subire, xi 29, 3. The use of a
passive infinitive in this way is noticeable: (liber) quem Gallus
recipi inter ceteros . . . postulaverat, vi 12, 13 cieri Narcissum
postulat, xi 30, 2; permitti Meherdaten . . . orabant, xi 10, 8; vete·
ranos coloniamque deduci impetrat, xii 27, 1.

Other instances may be seen in vi 12, 4; vi 19, 4; vi 23, 53
vi33, 1 ; xi26, 13 xii 11, 4; xii 29, 2.

The somewhat doubtful ‘ instabat . . . aperire’ of xi 34, 2 may be
referred to this use.

32 [44]. The accusative and infinitive, expressing an indirect
statement, is found with verbs not usually associated with it, as
eum . . . incolumem fore gratatur, vi 21, 5 : cf. Trebellenum incusans
popularium iniurias inultas sinere, iii 38, 4,

33 [45]. A personal construction is often found where in earlier
classical prose the impersonal construction would be usual; this is
specially common with verbs of accusing: incusabatur facile tole-
raturus exilium, vi 3, 3; Sex. Marius defertur incestasse filiam,
