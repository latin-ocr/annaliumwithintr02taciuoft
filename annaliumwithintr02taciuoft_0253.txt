BOOK XII, CH. 29, ξ 2 —Cll. 31, ξξ r—5

partivere. This active form is archaic. The past participle is
however used in passive sense by Caesar and Livy.

egregia . . . fide: abl. of quality, as is also ⁴ multa caritate' ancl
‘ maiore odio ⁹. ⁸ Subiectis’ is dative, parallel with ⁴ adversus nos ',
above. ‘ Displaying towards us an admirable loyalty, whilst by
their subjectsff owing either to their own (fickle) temperament, or
to the character produced by enslaveinent (abl. of cause)‚—they
were viewed with warm affection until they won their kingdom, and
with still warnier hatred after they had won it '.

dominationis: sor the case, cf. ‘ rerum adeptus est ’, iii 55, 1.

Chapter 31, ᾧ 1. At in Britannia, &o : the narrative here goes
back to the date of the appointment of Ostorius, who succeeded
Plautius Silvanus in 47 Α. D. P. Ostorius Scapula is known to have
been consul suffectus with a certain Vellius Rufus (perhaps the
Suillius Rufus of xi 1, 1) in Claudius‘ reign.

ξ 2. primis eventibus, ‘ by the first results of measures taken'.

rapit, ‘hurries ’ (by forced marches).

caesis qui: Intr. 11 21.

permitteret, following ‘ne '. ‘ In case a peace, formed without
friendly feelings or loyal intentions, should afford no security to
general and army alike.’

cunctaque castris Antonam et Sabrinam: so Med. The
passage is unintelligible without some alteration. The reading
‘cunctaque cis Trisantonam et Sabrinam’ involves the change of
one letter only [cis sor cas-]. Τρισαντὼν occurs in Ptolemy as the
name of a British river flowing to the south coast; this is not
taken to be the one referred to here, but the name may well be
one applied, like ‘Avon'‚ to several rivers. ‘Trannonus’ occurs
as the name sor the Trent in the ninth century, and this may be
the form into which Trisanton, or Trisantona, passed. This inter-
pretation suggests, then, that Ostorius, engaged in protecting the
friendly tribes of south Britain from attacks from the north, pre-
pared to bring into subjection a large tract os the Midlands, here
described as east of the Severn and south of the Trent, and his
operations provoked risings from the Iceni on the east, the Brigantes
on the north, and the Welsh tribes on the west.

ξ 3. quod: i. e. Ostorius' operations.

Iceni: the name occurs on coins as ‘Eceni’, probably =
‘ swordsmen ⁷. Their territory extended over the present counties
of Cambridgeshire, Norsolk, and Sufsolk. Their town, Venta
Icenorum, may be Norwich, or Caistor.

abnuere, ‘rebelled against ’.

accesserant: Intr. 11 5.

§4 aggere. A portion of the strong earthworks thrown up
by the lceni for protection on their western frontier survives in
the ‘Devil’s Dyke', crossing the road from Cambridge to New-
market.

ξ 5. perrumpere adgreditur: Intr. II 35.

peditum: to be taken with ‘ munia ’.
