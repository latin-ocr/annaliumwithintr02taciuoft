INTROUUCTION

but an appearance of virtue was still kept up while his mother's eye

was upon him.
This was the time when his great minister Seianus was at the

height of his influence. Seianus held the office of ‘praefectus
urbis ' as well as the command of the praetorian guards. These
he had concentrated within a camp close to the city wall, and in
virtue of his two appointments and his close connexion with the
emperor, in whose ‘imperium‚' though he was only an eques, he
was associated (iv 7, 2), he acquired an immense ascendancy in
Rome, and became in effect the emperor's vicegerent. Nobles
courted his favour as the necessary step towards obtaining office
(iv 1, 43 68, 2); an attack by one of his creatures was held to
make condemnation certain (iv 32, 2). His ambition, according
to Tacitus, was unbounded, and he schemed at removing all pos-
sible rivals that he might eventually succeed to the principate on
Tiberius’ death, To this end he contrived the murder of Tiberius'
son Drusus, and then began intriguing against the family of Ger-
manicus and Agrippina.

The whole of this period is described as one of ‘cruel orders,
incessant accusations, treacherous friendships' (iv 33, 3), and
indeed the domestic history of this time is largely taken up with
trials for state offences. The number of such cases rises to twenty
in the course of six years, but analysis of them shows that they
were by no means all unjustified, or the mere excesses of malicious
autocracy. In four cases serious charges were proved, and acquittal
would have been an abuse of justice¹; some of those condemned
were informers, as Firmius Catus (iv 31, 7); in three cases the
result was acquitta123 another case was indefinitely adjourned
(iv 66, 3) ; in another the emperor intervened to pardon (iv 31, 1) ;
and in another the gravest charge was dropped (iv 21, 4). The
remaining cases, however, do show a greater sensitiveness on the
part of the emperor towards libels, and a more pronounced tendency
to insist on condemnation. The attack on Cremutius Cordus (iv 34)
for a passage in his history, eulogizing Brutus and Cassius the mur-
derers of Julius Caesar, seems peculiarly harsh. Evidence was
