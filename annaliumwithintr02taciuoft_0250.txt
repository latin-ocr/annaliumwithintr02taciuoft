TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

accingeret: metaphor from girding on a sword; ‘ let him attach
to himself a youth ⁹, &o

ξ 3. biennio maiorem natu: so Med.; but it is known that
Nero was born in Dec., 41 A. D„ so that ‘triennio ’ would be
correct.

fflio anteponit: by adoption, Nero became Britannicus' equal
in position, and would then naturally take precedence as the elder.
The relations of Germanicus and Drusus in the family of Tiberius
were similar.

ξ 4. periti = ‘ docti ⁹, ‘ experts ’.

patricios : the term distinguishes them from the plebeian branch
of the family, the Claudii Marcelli. Tiberius had already become
one of the ‘ Iulii ' when he adopted Germanicus, and so received him
into that house.

Atto Clauso: xi 24, 1. ‘ And they had persisted in an unbroken
line from Attus Clausus!

Chapter 26, ξ 1. quaesitiore, &c., ‘ specially elaborate compli-
ments being paid to Domitius '.

rogata lex. This was a ‘ lex curiata ’, passed in the presence of
the ppnfiffs, the proper form whereby an adoption of a person ‘ sui
iuris’ w as effected. For this the concurrence of the people,
assembled 1n ‘curiae’ ‚w as supposed to be requisite‚ but this divi-
sion by‘ curiae ’had long become obsolete, and the‘ curiae’ were
represented by some lictors (properly thirty' in number).

nomen Neronis. His name from this time till his accession is
‘Ti. Claudius Nero Caesar‘, or ‘Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus
Germanicus ’.

augetur, ‘ is exalted '. Cf. ‘honoribus augebantur '‚ vi 8, 4.

Augustae. Livia had become ‘Augusta ’ by Augustus' will,
Antonia after the accession of her grandson (Gaius), Messalina only
by provincial adulation3 Agrippina is the first to receive the title
in her husband's lifetime and to treat it as conferring a substantia]
share of power. Nero gave the title to Poppaea, and from Domi-
tian's time it was generally borne by emperors’ wives.

§ 2. desolatus: poetical = ‘privatus ’. [So Statius, Theb. ix
672 ⁶ desolatumque magistro agmen '.] The removal of his atten-
dants is further described in ch. 41, 8.

perintempestiva, ⁴ extremely ill-timed ‘ ; a new word, 500 Intr.
ΙΙ 51.

salsi = ‘fraudis. ' For the case cf. ‘ intellegentem humani
divinique' luris'‚ iv 38, 3.

ᾗ 3. sive, &c., ‘whether this was really 50, or, winning sympathy
by his peril, he has retained the credit (of ability) without being put
to the proof of 1t’

Chapter 27, ξ 1. oppidum Ubiorum, ‘the capital of the Ubii’ ,
where Agrippina was born in 15 A. D. The colony of veterans
here planted was named‘ Colonia Agrippinensis' (or‘ Agrippinen-
sium ’,) sometimes Colonia Claudia Augusta Agrippinensium', or

‘Colonia Claudia Alffa' lt is the modern Cologne (Koln).
