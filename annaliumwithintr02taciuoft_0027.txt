46 [56-63]. The following are some of the most characteristic
usages in Tacitus ε

Apud is often used with names of places and countries as well as
with common names, in place of the locative or ‘in’ with ablative :
apud Cycladas insulas, v 10, 1 ; apud oppidum Edessam, xii 12, 4;
apud sorum, xii 7, 3. In xii 1, 1 it is equivalent to ‘ inter'.

Ad osten = ‘in regard to’: praecipuos ad scelera, vi 7, 33 ad
honesta . . . (levis), xi 33, 1.

Circa, = ‘ conceming 'z publica circa artes bonas socordia, xi 15,
1 ; circa necem Gaii Caesaris narratus, xi 29, 1. (So in Seneca and
Pliny mai.)

In, (a) with accusative, much used to express the effect intended
or resulting, like ἐπί or πρός; in diversum, xi 19, 1 ; in speciem, xii
44, 6 ; in barbarum corrupta, vi 42, 1 ; also used boldly in place of
a genitive or dative : amore in maritum, xi 26, 53 in fratrum filias
coniugia, xii 6, 5 ; adoptio in Domitium, xii 25, 1 ; tristia in bonos . . .
esse, vi 22, 2 ; in reliquos data venia, xii 32, 4 ;

(b) with ablative of a neuter adjective, used as alternative to the
employment of an adverb, or an adjective predicate: maxime in
lubrico egit, vi 51, 3 ; in incerto iudicium est, vi 22, 1.

quta is used metaphorically, as a preposition, = ‘next to‚’
‘ close upon’ : laqueum iuxta, v 9, 3 ; populi imperium iuxta liberta-
tem, vi 42, 33 and as an adverb in the sense of ‘pariter’: iuxta
invisi, vi 4, 1.

Per is used in expressions of time, where ablative might be
expected: per idem tempus, v 10, 1 ; per medium diei, xi 21, 23 or
has the force of an instrumental or modal ablative: animus per
libidines corruptus, xi 37, 5 ; per maerorem, v 6, 5 ; per deridiculum
auditur, vi 2, 2 ; per silentium, xi 37, 5 ; see also magnas per opes,
vi 22, 4.

Super, = de, frequently; vi 49, 3 ; xi 23, 1 ; xii 22, 1.

Simul is used as preposition, with ablative (like ἅμα), in vi 9, 5.
