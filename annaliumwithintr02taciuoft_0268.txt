TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

‘ in servitute ', has the sense of ‘ tenerentur ’‚ but with ‘pro libertis
= ⁴ should be treated ’.

§ 2. praetoria insignia: cf. xi 38, 5.

centiens quinquagiens: supply ‘ centena milia ’.

consu] designatus: he was one of the ‘ consules suffecti' of
this year. He is said to have shown ‘iustitia et industria’ as
governor of Asia in 61-62 A. D., and to have been one of Nero’s
victims in 66 A.D. (xvi 23).

censuit: as cos. design. he had to speak first on the motion.

§ 3. Cornelius Scipio: see xi 2, 5.

regibus Arcadiae ortus: Scipio claims for him descent from
Pallas, ancestor of Evander, after whom the original Pallanteum on
the Palatine Hill was named (Verg. Aen. viii 54). ‘ Pallas’ was
the name which he bore when a slave in Antonia’s household
(xi 29, 1), and on his liberation he probably took the narne
‘ M. Antonius Pallas ’.

ξ 5, fixum, &c.: this inscription is quoted at length by Pliny,
Ep. viii 6. It was set up near the statue of Julius Caesar in the
Forum Iulii.

sestertii ter miliens: 3oo‚000,000 sesterces.

54 Chapter 54, ξ 1. Felix: he also, like Pallas, bore the name
Antonius (Hisl. v 9, 5), and (according to Suidas) Claudius.
Suetonius mentions him among the most influential freedmen,
‘quem cohortibus et alis provinciaeque Iudaeae proposuit, trium
reginarum maritum '. Of these three wives one was Drusilla,
daughter of Herod Agrippa Ι ; another, a granddaughter of Antony
and Cleopatra, is named Drusilla by Tacitus (Hz'st. v 9) 3 the third
is unknown.

pari moderatione: said ironically.

iam pridem: this expression harmonizes with the view that he
was contemporary with, not successor t0‚ Cumanus (see below),
whose appointment dates from 48 A. D. Uos).

impune ε predicatively 3 sc. ‘futura '.

potentia: that of Pallas.

ξ 2. postquam : the occasion was that of the command of Gaius
to erect his effigy in the Temple (Hz'st. v 9), which Tacitus probably
described in a part of the lost books of the Annals, and here
referred to with a few words that have dropped out.

obtemperatum esset: the subj. depends on some such word as
⁴ quamquam ', which has been lost in the lacuna between ‘post—
quam ' and ‘ cognita ' 3 ‘though, on news of his death, the command
was not executed ’.

ξ 3. intempestivis, &c.‚ ‘by ill—tirned repression infuriated them
to worse crimes'.

aemulo, ‘while V. C. vied with him in misgovernment ’.

Ventidius Cumanus: Tacitus’ account is at variance with that
of Josephus (Ant. xx 5), who makes Cumanus sole governor, from
48-52 A. D., and represents Felix as not appointed until Cumanus was
deposed and banished‚ 32 Α. D., an account in accord with the usual
