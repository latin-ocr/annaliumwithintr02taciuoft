TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

§4 Taurum: he would cross a part of this chain, in coming
from Syria through Commagene to Cappadocia.

rediret . . . iubeturx cf. xiii 15, 3 ‘Britannico iussit exsurgeret ’.

Chapter 50, ξ 1. The chronology of these events is not clear.
In xiii 6, 1 we read that the second occupatiori of Armenia by the
Parthians (after the ‘atrox hiems' of ch. 50, 3) did not become
known at Rome till the end of 54 Α. D.; it presumably happened
in the earlier part of that year; so that the ‘atrox hiems ' would be
that of 53-54 A. D. The events of chs. 44—49 may well have
extended over a longer period than the year 51 Α. D.‚ to which they
are ascribed (eh. 44, 1).

casum, ‘ opportunity ’ ; so in xi 9, 1.

a maioribus suis. In recent times Vonones (ii 4, 3) and Arsaces
son of Artabanus (vi 31, 2) had been at least nominal kings of
Armenia, and Parthians had ruled it during the captivity of Mithri-
dates (xi 8, 1) ; but the expression here points rather to the Arsacid
kings of the second and first century B.C., who claimed to be of
the same stock as the Parthian royal race.

pars domus, ‘ member of his family ’. His other brother,
Pacorus, held Media (xv 2, Ι).

ξ 2. Artaxata: on the Araxes, near Erivan. The word is some-
times treated as a neut. plur„ sometimes as fem. sing.

Tigranocerta : ascribed by Kiepert to the site of ruins known as
Tell-Ermen, a little south-west of Mardin, thirty-seven miles from
Nisibis, and in the extreme south of Armenia.

ξ 3. tabes, ‘ pestilence ⁷. omittere praesentia, ⁴ abandon affairs
on the spot ⁹. Cf. xi 18, 2.

§4 defectores: so in xi 8, 5.

in tempore: cf. ch. 46, 2 note.

ξ 5. patientiam abrumpunt: cf. ‘abrumpi dissimulationem ',
xi 26, 1.

Chapter 51, ξ 2. utcumque: to be taken with ‘ toleravit ’,
‘endured somehow ’. So Livy xxix 15, 1 ⁶ quae . . . utcumque
tolerata essent '.

festinatione continua: causal abl.

§3 adlevare: the word is proper to the action of raising a
petitioner from a suppliant’s position 3 ‘ adlevat supplicem ’, ch. 19, 1.
Perhaps Zenobia had dismounted and knelt in entreaty. [Other-
wise the word is used metaphorically = ‘ encouraged’.]

ξ 4. violentia: causal abL, co—ordinated with adj. 3 cf. Intr.
ΙΙ 643 ‘carried away by his love, and accustomed as he was to
violence ’.

acinacen: a short sabre.

ripam ad: anastrophe; see Intr. II 55.

Araxes: this river passed under the walls of Artaxata, where
was the ‘ regia ’ (50, 5) from which he was escaping.

Hiberos : if the text is sound this must be taken in apposition with
‘regnum ⁷. ‘ Made his way to his father's kingdom, the ‘ Hiberi ’.
The construction is unusual, and ‘ Hiberos ’ may be a gloss.
