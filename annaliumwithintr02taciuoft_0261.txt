Book ΧΠ, cri. 41, ξ 2--‹:H. 1‘2‚§§ ι-5

§8. morte: Sosibius (xi 1, 2) suffered this (Dio lx 32, 5). Dio
adds κάκ τούτου παραδοῦσα αὐτὸν οἷς ἤθελεν, ἐκάκου ὅσον ἐδύνατο, καὶ
οὔτε τῷ πατρὶ συνεῖναι οὔτε ἐς τὸ δημόσιον προϊέναι εἴα, ἀλλ’ ἐν ιὶδέσμω
τρόπον τινὰ φυλακῇ εἶχεν. ’

chapter 42, ξ 1. cura, and ‘ curare ‘, are often used os military 42
command by Tacitus.

audebat, ni . . . exsolverentur: Intr. 11 38.

Lusius Geta: cs. xi 31, 1.

Rufrius Crispinus: cs. xi 1, 3.

ᾗ 2. ambitu, ‘ rivalry ’ in courting the soldiers. The partition os
this command between two praesects is ascribed by Dio (lii 24, 1)
to Maecenas' advice to Augustus. This was not, however, invariably
followed: thus Seianus had had sole command, under Tiberius.
After the death of Burrus, in 62 Α. Ι)., the praetorians were again put
under the command of two men, viz. Faenius Rufus and Sofonius
Tigellinus (xiv 51, 5).

Burrus: the name is an old synonym for ‘Rufus ’3 ‘ Burrus ’ or
⁴ Purrus‘ is Ennius' form for ‘ Pyrrhus ⁹. An inscription found at
Vaison records his previous career. He was a native probably of
the Gallie Vasio, of equestrian rank, served as ‘ tribunus milituin’ in
a legion not specified, and was then agent (‘ procurator’) in succes-
sion to Livia, Tiberius, and Claudia. He was consequently already
a trusted servant of ‘the household of Caesar' when promoted to
the praetorian prefecture, and like Seneca was a provincial. His
‘ nomen ’ Afranius may indicate that an ancestor had served under

the Pompeian general of that name, and had received Roman
citizenship from him.

§ 3. fastigium, ‘ dignity ’. ¹

carpento: a two-wheeled carriage with an ornamental cover. A
similar privilege was allowed to magistrates and priests on solemn
occasions: it was the ordinary privilege of Vestals, and had been
accorded to Messalina, who was drawn in such a carriage at the
triumph of Claudius (Suet. Cl. 17).

saeris: objects of worship, such as the Palladium kept in the
temple os Vesta, and perhaps the images of the Penates of
Rome.

imperatore: her father Germanicus had received this title from

{fferi'us in 15 A. D., aster his campaign in Germany against the
atti.

sororem: of Gaius.
quam . . . fuisse unicum . . . exemplum est: equivalent to
‘ quarn . . . fuisse solam . . . tradunt'. ‘Who was the only instance

so far of one who, herself an emperor's daughter, was sister, wife,
and daughter of the ruler of the world!

ξ 4. Vitellius: cf. xi 2, 4 and vi 28, 1.
§5 maiestatis: trials under this offence, so common under
Tiberim, had been discontinued by Claudius at the beginning of

his reign (Dio lx 3, 6), and were revived under Nero first in
62 Α. D. (xiv 48, 3).
