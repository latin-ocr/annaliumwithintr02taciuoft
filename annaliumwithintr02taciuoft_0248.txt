TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

auxit, ‘ extended’. One feature of this extension was the in-
clusion of the Aventine.

more priseo: from a passage in Seneca we learn that it was only
the acquisition of Italian territory that justified an enlargement of
the pomerium. Claudius' action therefore is to be regarded as
the result of some enlargement of the bounds of Italy, possibly the
incorporation ofthe Amauni (near Trent)‚ rather than of his conquest
of Britain.

ξ 5. nisi L. Sulla et divus Augustus. Seneca and Gellius
attest Sulla’s extension‚ but not any extension by Augustus. Nor
does the Alonumenlzcm Ancyranum record any such act by
Augustus; and so it is possible that Tacitus and Dio (lv 6, 6)
were misled on this point, perhaps by the accounts they followed of
Augustus’ work in dividing the city into ‘regiones ⁵, in the course
of which a definition of the city’s boundaries would have to be
made.

Chapter 24, ξ 1. Regum, &c., ‘there are various accounts of
the pretensions or the renown of kings in that matter ’ ; i. e. some
of the kings extended the pomerium through vanity in respectos
pretended conquests, others to record the glory of real ones. Livy
mentions no extension of the pomerium except that by Servius
{Pullius (i 44} 3), though both Tullus and Ancus enlarged the city
i 30 and 33 .

ξ 2. forum boarium ε near ‘San Giorgio in Velabro ⁹, between
the Tiber and the western corner of the Palatine.

aereum tauri simulacrum : a statue forming part of the plunder
brought from Greece, and the chief specimen in Rome of Aeginetan
bronze. It was placed in the cattle-market as the most appropriate
site. ‘ Quia '‚ &c.‚ gives the reason for taking this as the starting·
point of the line, ‘ sulcus '.

designandi oppidi: see Intr. 11 26.

sulcus: the line so traced was the outer limit of the pomerium,
within which the wall of defenee was built afterwards. [See Ov.
Fast. iv 821 and folh] The ceremony is stated to have been of
Etruscan origin, and, if so, was probably not observed when Rome
was first founded as a primitive Latin town.

Herculis aram. The ‘ Ara Maxima ’, near the northern end, or
‘carceres ’, of the Circus. The deity to which it was originally
erected was probably the Italian Hercules, the presiding spirit of
the homestead and of property, the god of good saith (‘Deus Fidius').
Tradition, however, made it belong to the worship of the Greek
Heracles, instituted by Evander to commemorate the slaying of
Cacus (Verg. Aen. viii 179 and foll.).

ξ 3. lapides, ‘ boundary stones ³, ‘ cippi pomerii ³. It seems
these were left to mark out the course of the Luperci when they ran
round the site of the ancient city on the Palatine at the festival
held annually on the 15th of February.

ad aram Consi z this, and the next two places enumerated, were
probably turning points in the line, and marked by terminal ‘ cippi ’.
