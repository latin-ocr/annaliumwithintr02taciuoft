INTRODL'CTION

disturbances in Parthia, fortunately for Rome, averted reprisals
from that quarter3 a temporary revolution had driven Phraates
from his throne and had put a rival, Tiridates, in his place, and
at the time of Octavian’s success Phraates was only just recover-
ing his position.

On succeeding to the undivided possession of the empire, Octa-
vian took no steps to carry out Antony’s grandiose schemes of
conquest in the East, though circumstances made him heir to
Antony's enmity with both Parthia and Armenia. But his army
was in no condition to enter upon distant and difficult enterprises;
the veterans were clamouring for their discharge and their rewards;
while Octavian himself desired to settle his own position at horne on
a secure basis, and the questions arising on the European frontiers of
his empire concerned him more nearly. He was content, for the
present, to leave the states of Asia for the most part under the
arrangements that he found prevailing : then he returned to Rome,
and for several years was fully occupied with the settlement of the
constitution, and the task of dealing with those parts of his Euro-
pean empire where Rome’s hold was not fully secure¹.

At the same time, there was at the end of the Actian war a wide—
spread feeling in Rome that the new ruler (now entitled Augustus)
was to enter on a career of conquest in the East as well as the
West. Passages in Vergil and Horace, published at this time,
indicate a general expectation that Augustus was to bring both
Parthia and Britain into the Roman empire ². However‚ so sar as
the East was concerned, Augustus avoided war3 for the present
there was no danger imminent, and he might later on improve
Rome’s position in the East by other means. There was always
the prospect of sudden deposition‚ by internal revolution, of the
Parthian and Armenian monarchs, and Augustus gave protection to
refugee princes who might at some future occasion be installed in
their stead and govern in the Roman interest. Thus he had,

against the Dacians, the organization of Gaul, and campaigns in the Alps and
in Spain, belong to this period.
