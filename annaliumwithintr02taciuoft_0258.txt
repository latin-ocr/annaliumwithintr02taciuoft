TACITUS ANNALS : NOTES

circumfundunt: the earlier usage, of the passive with dative,
also occurs in Tacitus ; e. g. ch. 27, 3.

§4 ni nuntiis, ἃς. : the text of this passage is uncertain, and
it is therefore doubtful whether its construction is correct. It
appears from the early part of the next chapter that the main body
carne to the support of 1115 beleaguered troops, so that‘ ex castellis’
may be connected wr 'th‘ nuntiis', though strictly for this purpose
the phrase requires the addition of some such participle as ‘missis’.

Had not help, in consequence of a message dispatched from the
nearest forts, been sent to the beleaguered forces, they would have
been absolutely wiped out? (⁴ Obsidio’, dative from‘ obsidium’ .)

obsidio copiarum = ‘copiis obsessis'. Intr. ll 57.

Chapter 39, ξ 1. sistebat, ni . . . excepissent. Intr. II 38.

pro meliore fuit, ‘was equivalent to a success' Cf. ‘pro
firmato stetit magistratus eius ius’ ,Liv. iv 7, 3. ’

ξ 3. in modum latrocinii, ‘after the fashion of guerilla fighting’.

ut cuique, &c., ‘taking place, according to the opportunity or
valour of each party, on the spur of the moment, or from prearranged
design'. ‘Proviso' does not occur elsewhere in this sense = ‘re
ante provisa '‚ but is probably formed on the model of ‘ improviso ',
common in Cicero.

(For the change from asyndeton to connexion by particles cf.
Intr. II 64.)

ἓ 4. imperatoris: i. e. Ostorius,

Sugambri. The destruction of part of this tribe and the
settlement of the rest ofthem on the west side of the Rhine seems to
have been carried out by Tiberius m 8 Β. C. [References to their
conquest are made by Horace' 1n Od. iv 2, 343 14, 51. ]

in Gallias: i. e. on to the Gallie side ofthe Rhine. It was on this
side that the two German provinces lay, but the west side of the
Rhine continued to be spoken of as ‘ripa Gallica’ , even after the
two German provinces had been constructed along it.

ξ 5. avar-itia: caus‘al ablative.

tamquam: Intr. 11 50.

Chapter 40, ᾗ 1. A. Didium: see ch. 15, 1. The date of his
appointment is generally taken to be 52 A. D., and he seems to have
held it for rather more than fixe years.

integras: i. e. in the state in which the death of Ostorius had
left them.

Manlius Valens: mentioned in stl. i 64, 7 as legatus of a
newly- -raised legion in 69 A. D. He was consul in 96 A. D. at the
age of ninety (Dio lxvii 47, 5).

auctaque, 815. The sentence is awkward. ‘Et apud hostes’
seems to be answ ered by‘ atque illo augente'. ‘The account of the
affair was magnified, both on the part of the enemy who thus sought
to intimidate the approaching commander, while he too exaggerated
the report, that he might procure the greater honour from their sub-
jection and have a better excuse 1f they maintained their resistance.’

compositi: 501 Med. The participle may be taken as nom. pl,
