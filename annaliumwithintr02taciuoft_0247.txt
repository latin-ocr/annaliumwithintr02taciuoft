proconsul of Bithynia in, or before, 48 Α, 1). He seems to have
been expelled from tlie senate, to which he was restored twenty
years later by Otho (Hist. i 77, 6).

Chapter 23, ξ 1. Gallia Narbonensis was under senatorial 23
mle, and was now completely Romanized (‘ Italia verius quain
provincia ¹, Pliny).

ut senatoribus, &c. Under the Republic, senators who desii-ed
leave of absence from the capital to attend to their property, could
often obtain it under a ‘ libera legatio' conferred by the senate.
Augustus, shortly after Actium, sorbade senators to reside out of
Italy without his permission; those, however, who had estates in
Sicily might go there when they pleased. A similar concession was
now extended by Claudius to senators coming from Narbonese Gaul.

iure quo, δία, ‘ under the privilege applying to Sicily'.

§ 2. Itur-aea had been subdued by Pompeius Magnus in 63 B.C.,
and made part of the dominions of Herod the Great‚ after whose
death it passed to his son Philip.

Sohaemus: made king of Ituraea by Gaius, in 39 Α. D.

Agrippa: grandson of Herod the Great‚ He had received
the northern tetrarchies of Palestine, with the title of king,
from Gaius, and sor his assistance to Claudius at his acces-
sion was rewarded by the addition of Judaea and Samaria, so
that his kingdom was as extensive as that of Herod the Great‚ and
‘ludaei ’ here should be taken in a wide sense, covering all his
dominion. His death (Acts xii 23) may be referred to 44 A. D.
Tacitus perhaps deferred mention of it till nOW, so as to record
together the incorporation of Judaea and Ituraea.

provinciae Suriae additi: these districts would be under
‘ procuratores ’, subordinate to the legatus of Syria.

ξ 3. Salutis augurium. A ceremony in which the will of the
gods was sought by divination by the augurs as to whether public
prayers might be offered for the general health of the State. This
might only be done on an occasion of absolute immunity from war
or warlike preparation.

lxxv annis omissum: the ceremony had been revived
by Augustus in 29 B.C., having lapsed for many years owing
to thelconstant civil and foreign wars of the latter period of the
Repub ic.

continuari, ‘to be made annual'.

§4 pomerium: Gellius’ definition of this, drawn from the books
of the augum, describes it as a belt of ground marking the circumfer-
ence of the city, defined by fixed boundaries on the inner side of the
city wall, and marking the limit of ‘urbani auspicii ’ (thespace
within which auguries for the city could be taken). The traditional
derivation is from ‘post murum ’ (so Varr0‚ Plutarch, and Livy).
The outer limit of this consecrated belt carne to be regarded as of
more importance than the inner : beyond it the powers of the urban
magistrates ended. The emperor's ‘proconsulare imperium ’and
‘tribunicia potestas ’ were however independent of such limitation.
