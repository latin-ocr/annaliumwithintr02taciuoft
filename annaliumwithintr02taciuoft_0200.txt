paenitentiam, ‘change of mind '.
paedorem, ‘signs of neglect’3 he remained ‘inluvie obsitus’

(ch· 43, 3)-
adverteret, ‘ attract ’.

ξ 3. simul fama, διο, ‘terrified by the news as well as his rival’s
presence ’. The omission of the preposition marks the effect of the

ξ 4. ne animo quidem, ‘ had not yet sufficiently combined even
in the will to obey', still less in readiness to act.

ξ 5. amne: the Tigris, which he had crossed to Ctesiphon.

Elymaeis: they lived on the coast at the head of the Persian
Gult‘, and could not be ‘ a tergo ' to Tiridates, as were the Armenians.
Very probably their position was misapprehended by Tacitus:
(there may, however, have been a branch of the tribe in another
district). It is possible also to apply ‘a tergo' to ‘Elymaeis et
ceteris ’ only, understanding that these were to harass Artabanus in
the rear when he advanced against Tiridates. ,

ξ 7. Arabum: those of Osrhoene, round Edessa in N W.
Mesopotamia, are meant (cf. xii 12, 3).

exsolvit, ‘ relieved all his adherents from any shame at deserting
him’. Affairs in the East are resumed in xi 8, 1. In the interval,
Mithridates secured the kingdom of Armenia, Artabanus regained
Parthia and made peace with Vitellius, and died in possession of the
kingdom in 40 A. D.

tween the Palatine and the Aventine.

ipsoque Aventino: sc. ‘deusto' ; so ‘ deusto monte Caelio ³, iv

at the side of the Palatine near the Forum.

scaenam Pompeiani theatri, ‘the stage of Pompey’s theatre’.
Its destruction by fire, in 22 A. D., is mentioned in iii 72, 4. This
theatre was constructed in the Campus Martius by Pompey in his
second consulship, 55 Β. C. , and was the first permanent structure of
the kind in Rome.

ξ 3. quattuor progeneri: for Cn. Domitius see vi 1, 1; for
Cassius and Vinicius see ch. 15, 1 3 for Rubellius Blandus ch. 27, 1.
