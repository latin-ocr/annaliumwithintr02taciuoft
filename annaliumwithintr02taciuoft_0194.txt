TACITUS ANNALS : NOTES

portae', a pass in the centre of the Caucasian range, the modern
pass of Dariel, connecting the Iberian town Hermasta (Tiflis) with
the upper valley of the Terek.

ξ 5. qui: i. e. those Sarmatians who sided with the Parthians.

unum reliquum: the route along the western shore of the
Cas ian.

etiesiarum: winds blowing from the north for thirty days from
about ul v 20.

pulsJoqire introrsus freto, ‘the sea being driven back upon itself ’.

brevia: probably taken from Verg. Α en. i 111.

Chapter 34, ξ 1. infensare pabula, ‘ravaged their foraging

round ’.
g regem, ‘the prince’3 probably Orodes had assumed also the
title of king of Armenia.

ᾧ 3. feruntque: so a legend quoted by Justin (xlii 2, 11) states
that Jason was driven out of Thessaly by the daughters of Pelias,
that he became reconciled to Medea and reinstated Aeetes, whom
he found in exile, on the throne of Colchis; that he gained great
victories and assigned territory from his conquests to his followers
from Greece.

The real origin of the Hiberi and Albani was Scythic‚ and the
Albani were akin to and sometimes confused with the Alauni or Alani.

inanem . . . vacuos: the words seem to imply that the story
followed by Tacitus was that Aeetes was dead when Jason returned
to Colchis.

ξ 4. de nomine eius, ‘ called after his name' (cf. Verg. Aen. i
277). Legends of Jason were widely spread in Albania and Iberia,
and their extension was stimulated by the Thessalians who had fol-
lowed Alexander (Grote‚ i ch. 13, p. 328 and foll.).

ξ 5. mercennario milite: an ablative of accompanying circum-
stance, hardly needing further definition either as ‘absolute ⁹, or
‘ablative of quality ' (Intr. ΙΙ 22).

ξ 6. Medorum: the word is used for the whole Parthian army3
so Horace often interchanges the names ‘ Mede ’, ‘Persian ⁹, and
‘Parthian '. The word is here the more appropriate as the Par-
thians had adopted the ‘perlucida ac fluida vestis’ of the Medes

ust. xli 2 l.

‘sinere ’ with accus. is found in Pliny ma. and poets.

ξ 2. sequi vel fugere . . . suetus: for ‘Parthian tactics' cf.
Verg. G. iii 31 ‘ fidentemque fuga Parthum versisque sagittis’ ;
Hor. Od. i 19, 11 ‘versis animosum equis Parthum’3 also Od. ii
13, 17.
