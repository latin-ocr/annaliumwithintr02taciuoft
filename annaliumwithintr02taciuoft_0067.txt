CONQUEST OF BRITAIN

Augustus' reign the island had, according to Strabo, become entirely
friendly to Rome. The same relations continued under Tiberius,
This was due no doubt to the policy of Cunobelinus, king of the
Catuvellauni, whose authority was paramount over the south-eastern
portion os the island, and whose long reign continued from the latter
years of Augustus to the beginning of the reign of Claudius.

Claudius’ determination to annex Britain was occasioned by the
unsettled state of things arising upon the death of Cunobelinus‚
when the chiefs who succeeded to his power were hostile to Rome.
Adminius, one of the late king’s sons, had fled to Gaius, and there
was also Bericus, who was a suppliant to Claudius pressing sor
reinstatement. The imperial policy required either that Britain
should be under a king acknowledging the protectorate of Rome,
or that it should become a province. Caratacus, who had succeeded
to Cunobelinus' position, was hostile to Roman dictation; and the
prospect of extending the Roman dominions across the Ocean and
winning a triumph for the achievement had an irresistible appeal
to Claudius’ vanity.

The expedition, which was sent in the third year of Claudius’
reign (43 A. D.), was well and adequately organized. The numbers
and quality of the troops were such as to ensure success. Four
seasoned legions were taken for the purpose, three from Germany
and one from Pannonia: their numbers may be estimated as from
twenty to twenty-five thousand, and the army would contain besides
rather more than double that number of auxiliaries. The officers were
eminent and able. At the head of the army was Aulus Plautius
Silvanus, ‘a senator of the highest reputation' (Dio), consul fourteen
years before, at some time legatus of Delmatia, and now probably
transferred from one of the highest provincial appointments. Among
his subordinates was Vespasian‚ so far of only praetorian rank, and
acting as legatus of the Second Legion, marked out for future emi-
nence by his successes in the ensuing campaign3 there were also
Flavius Sabinus, Vespasian’s brother, the city prefect of 69 A.D.‚
and Hosidius Geta, who had fought with success in Mauretania.
In the personal train of Claudius carne Servius Sulpicius Galba, the
subsequent emperor, M. Licinius Crassus Frugi, a consular of long
standing, the senator Valerius Asiaticus, and Ti. Plautius Silvanus
Aelianus, distinguished subsequently for his achievements in Moesia.
