THE CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLY PRINCIPATE

ξ 1. In the constitution solemnly inaugurated by his acceptance
os the title of ‘Augustus' at the beginning of B. C. 27, Octavian
was content to be designated not as ‘king ’ or ‘dictator‚' but only
as ‘prince.' If this term is, as lias been commonly supposed,
sliortened from ‘princeps senatus,' it implied only that (as was
no doubt the fact) his name stood first on the roll of senators, and
would convey no idea of his relation to the state. The fact,
however, that he is always spoken of not as ‘ princeps senatus ’ but
as simply ‘ princeps ’ seems, together with many other considera-
tions‚ to point to the conclusion that the term, if an abbreviation
of any kind, is rather that of some such an expression as ⁴ princeps
civitatis‚' and was intended to designate his general position as first
citizen of the Republic, which he claimed to have in other respects
restored in its entirety.

Thus understood, the title conveys no monarchical idea, and
does not even imply magistracy; though certain powers always
held with it made the princeps first magistrate of the state.

ξ 2. Of these, the first and most important was the ‘imperium
proconsulare‚' whereby, in contrast to those holding a more
limited ‘ imperium‚' he was distinctively the sole ‘imperator ¹,’ or
‘emperor‚’ of the Roman empire, and commander—in-chief of all
its fleets and armies. Not only the ‘legati' of his own special
provinces, but also the proconsuls of those left to the senate,
ranked as his subordinates; and all military operations were held
by a fiction to be conducted under his ‘auspicia '3 while, by
a further extension, this power was valid also in Italy and even
within the walls of Rome, giving him not only the supreme
command of the home army and police, but also power of life and

* death over all citizens, even of senatorial rank, and a special juris-

1 The use of tlr'is title, as commemorative of victories (see ii 18 and
Intr. p. lii), is distinet from its use to denote supreme command.
