ΤΙ miluus

of the ‘ delatores,' the informers who worked up evidence of guilty
words or acts against the Emperor, obtaining rewards when they
effected a conviction.

Νοιν, we may notice that at the outset the practice of bringing
these accusations was not encouraged by Tiberius, nor did he
allow it to be exercised without moderation. In this first period of
his rule twelve cases are recorded by Tacitus, in two of which ¹ the
acts (if proved) would have been indictable sor treason under any
govemment ; in three cases the charge of ‘ maiestas' was dismissed
by the emperor himself; and in three more instances the result was
acquittal (i 74; iii 49; iii 7o; i 74; ii 50). On another occasion os
such a prosecufion, for an offence of words, death was inflicted by
the Senators without consulting Tiberius, and he expostulated with
them for their precipitate action (iii 51).

We see, then, that at first Tiberius was not eager that these
prosecutions should be multiplied, or that condemnation should
follow accusation as a matter of course. At the same time, Tiberius,
in not repressing them altogether, was responsible sor their intro-
duchon, and encouraged their extension by permitting a share of
the property of those condemned to go to the accusers. Nor was
this a time when strong measures were necessary as a precaution
against insurrection; there was a general submissiveness to his
rule; the Senators‚ from amongst whom most of the victims of the
prosecutions for ‘maiestas’ were drawn, were, as he scornfully
said of them, ‘ willing to be slaves ’ (iii 65, 3), That he permitted
these prosecutions was due, probably, not to the thirst sor blood
which Tacitus would ascribe to him, butsather to a certain timidity
of nature which led him to think that his own security might be
the better maintained through the intimidation by this means os
possible opponents to his domination.

We now corne to the third of the periods into which our historian
divides T iberius’ life. For the next six years, while his mother
still lived, a period covering the ninth to the fifteenth year of his
reign, and the sixty-fourth to the seventieth of his life, he is said to
have been ‘inter bona malaque mixtus’3 some evil traits, that is,
such as cruelty and covetousness, began to escape from their disguise,
