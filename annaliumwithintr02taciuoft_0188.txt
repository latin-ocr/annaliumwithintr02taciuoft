TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

foregoing facts were barely credible were it not that still worse was
positively attested.

epistulae: letters to Tiberius read before the senate.

§3. egregium: Intr. 11 2.

exspes: a poetical word 3 Intr. 11 51.

nurum, &c. : supply ‘necasset ’‚ by zeugma, from ‘ caedibus
complevisset’ ; Intr. ΙΙ 60. Agrippina was not yet dead, but in
banishment at Pandateria (App. p. 3): Drusus evidently antici-
pated her execution.

ξ 4. obturbabant, ‘ interrupted ⁹.

tegendis sceleribus: cf. ch. 51, 5 ‘ occultum ac subdolum fin·
gendis virtutibus ⁵. lt is not clear whether the case is ablat. of
respect or dat. of purpose.

verbere: the singular is a poetic usage 3 so in v 9, 2.

extrema, δια, ‘ the barest sustenance necessary to support life ’.

Chapter 25, ξ 1. provixisse, ‘had lived on’. The compound
seems to be one coined by Tacitus: Intr. ΙΙ 51.

nissil si, ⁶(1 think sol) except on the supposition that ’, ‘unless
possib y ⁹.

qui videretur: amplifying ‘adsimulatus est ’, ‘ by the with-
holding of food her death was made to assume the appearance of
one sels—inflicted ⁹.

ξ 2. enimvero: the particle marks a transition frorn the less to
the more important consideration.

impudicitiam: no such charge was made at her arrest (v 3, 4).
Gallus, moreover, was old enough to be her father, and so far from
ever appearing as her partisan is mentioned in iv 71, 3 as encourag-
ing Tiberius to proceed against her.

ξ 3. aequi: used as a substantive, ‘a position of equality ⁹, i. e.
with other subjects. The phrase is apparently from Statius (leeb.
3, 602) ‘ superum contemptor et aequi impatiens'.

exuerat, ‘had put off feminine vices by assuming masculine
interests '.

ᾗ 4. iactavit, ‘prided himself on the fact that ’.

ξ 5. quintum decimum: usually ‘ante’ precedes the ordinal
number in such expressions. It is similarly omitted in ch. 50, 7.

Chapter 26, ξ 1. Cocceius Nerva: mentioned in iv 58, 1
as accompanying Tiberius on his final departure from Rome to
Capreae in 26 A. D. He had already been ‘ consul suffectus ’, and
was ‘ curator aquarum ’ for some years before his death.

principi: the case is· uncertain, the MS. reading ‘principis ⁹,
‘ constant in his attendance on the emperor'.

divini iuris, pontifical law.

ξ 2. grave conscientiae, ‘ a blow to his sels-esteem’.

ξ 3. abstinentiam cibi coniunxit,‘ persisted in abstention from
food'3 cf. ⁴ sex annos coniunxit' <‘ spent six consecutive years')
iv 57, 2.

ira et metu : sc. ‘ tanto magis commotus '.

ξ 4. Plancinam traxit, ‘ involved Plancina also ⁹. Her behaviour
