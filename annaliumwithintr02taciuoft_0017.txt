SYNTAX

history ¹. The effort at variety os expression, besides being natural
in the case os an orator, is further due to the historian’s desire to
relieve what he feels to be the oppressit-e monotony of his subject ²,

by saying the same thing with the utmost variety of expression,

’ by osten giving the sentence an unexpected turn, by inventing new

words or new senses of words, or reviving such as had become
somewhat obsolete.

Os the various usages noted in the following sections, com-
paratively few are altogether peculiar to Tacitus; but many are
new in prose, and all are so far Tacitean that they are used by

him with more boldness and freedom than by earlier prose
authors.
