PREFACE

Tffls volume has been prepared on the same scale and with
the same purpose as my edition of Books xiii-xvi of the Ameals.
1t is designed to serve the needs of students requiring a
less copious and advanced commentary than that given in
Mr- Furneaux’s large edition. In substance the Introductions
and Notes are drawn from Mr. Furneaux’s work, but I have
ventured to give explanations or translations of my own in
certain passages, left without comment by him, which seemed
to me likely to present difficulty to students as yet unfamiliar
with Tacitus’ peculiarities of expression. I have endeavoured
to make this volume as far as possible sels-contained, by taking
illustrations of Tacitus' diction mostly from passages in the
books given in the text, and by stating the chief facts of im-
portance that are related in any other part of the Annals about
the personages mentioned in this part of the narrative.

The Text is that of Furneaux’s edition, 1894. Ι have not
thought it consistent with the plan of this book to give more
than the briefest discussion of the points where his readings
differ from those of other editors.

My best thanks are due to my friend and colleague, Pro-
fessor F. Brooks‚ of the University of Bristol‚ for his kind help
in the work of scrutinizing the proof-sheets sor misprints or

misstatements.
