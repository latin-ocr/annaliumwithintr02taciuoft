TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

breviore spatio: the completion of the conquest of Gaul by
Julius Caesar in the period 58-50 B.C. suggests a contrast with the
long resistance of Spain and the failure to subdue Germany; some
of the Eastern conquests were much more quickly achieved.

continua ac fida pax: the rising of Iulius Florus in 21 A.D.
(Arm. iii 40) is ignored.

ξ 11. plebeii: the allusion is to the admission of plebeians to the
magistracies which at first were monopolized by the patricians.

Latini: an instance is afforded by Ti. Coruncanius (a native of
Tusculum), who was consul in 280 B.C.

[Magistraeies would only be open to a few of the Latin towns
whose citizens had the full rights of Roman citizens; not to those
who possessed merely the ‘Caerite franchise '.]

Italiae: i. e. after the Social VVar. Thus, Ventidius Bassus, a
native of Picenum, taken prisoner in the Social VVar in his infancy,
subsequently became consul and was awarded a triumph in 38 B. C.

chapter 25, ξ 1. primi: it is not clear whether Tacitus means that
the Aeduan chiefs were taken first among those admitted to the
new privilege, or that the privilege was at first limited sor a time to
these ancient allies of Rome. Their admission into the senate was
probably effected by the direct ⁴ adlectio’ of the princeps in his
censorial capacity.

ξ 2. foederi: the date of this treaty is unknown, but the Aedui
are called ⁴ socii ⁹ as early as 121 B.C. (Livy, Epz't. lxi).

fraternitatis nomen: Caesar speaks of the Aedui as ‘fratres
consanguineosque saepenumero ab senatu appellatos ’ (Caes. B. G.
i· 33, 2)-

ᾗ 3. in numerum patriciorum adscivit. When Julius Caesar
and Augustus added to the patriciam, they acted by special law
(see below) 3 Claudius, and after him Vespasian and Titus, confer
patrician rank by virtue of their eensorial powers. Such grants were
made to individuals (e. g. L. Salvius Otho, father of the emperor,
P. Plautius Pulcher, brother of the emperor's former wife Plautia
Urgulanilla, and possibly C. Silius, were thus ennobled at this time).
Anciently when addition was made to the ‘patricii ⁹, the honour
would be conferred on whole families, not merely on individuals,
and would be effected by co-optation by the existing patrician
‘ curiae ’.

vetustissimum quemque, ‘ senators of longest standing ⁹.

quas Romulus, &Q According to Livy (i 8, 7) the 100 senators
of Romulus were the founders of the original patriciate. Besides
these the houses supposed to have come in with the Sabines under
Tatius, or on the destruction of Alba, were still ‘ maiorum gentium ’.
Those styled ‘ minorum gentium ’ are represented by all authorities
except Tacitus as the families derived from the 100 senators added
by Tarquinius Priscus (Livy i 35, 6). Tacitus seems to have con-
fused the tradition about Tarquin with that about Brutus, who is
said (Livy ii 1, 10) to have made up the senate, weakened by the last
king, to 300, by adding ‘conscripti' from the ‘primores equestris
