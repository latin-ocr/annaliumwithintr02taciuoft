TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

ᾗ 2. non eo ventum ut, ‘they were not in a position to ’.

consilia: contrasted with ‘ audacia ’. ‘ Innoxia’ is predicative.
‘ To the innocent deliberate plans were Sase‚ but sor detected crime
security must be sought from a bold stroke!

ᾗ 3. caelibem: he had divorced his wife, ch. 12, 2.

§4 insidiis: probably dative, ‘unsuspicious of any plot’3 cf.
‘(Seianus Tiberium) sibi uni incautum (effecit) ’.

irae properum: cf. ‘oblatae occasionis propera ⁹, xii 66, 2 and
Intr. ΙΙ 24.

ξ 5. amore: causa] abl. Intr. ΙΙ 19.

ne, ‘from sear lest ’.

ᾗ 6. nomen matrimonii, ‘ name of wife ’.

euius, &c.‚ ‘a pleasure which with the abandoned outlasts all
others '.

prodigos: the adj. is found only here in this sense, ἄσωτος.

,ξ 7. expectato: see Intr. II 21.

Ostiam proficisceretur: Claudius had carried out great works
at Ostia to improve the harbour. His visit on this occasion is said
by Dio (lx 31, 4) to have been πρὸς ἐπίσκεψιν σίτου. The sacrifice
mentioned by Tacitus may have been one for the safe arrival of
corn from abroad.

Chapter 27, ξ 1. securitatis, ⁶ recklessness ’.

nedum, ‘ much more ⁹. So xiii 20, 5 ‘ cuicumque, nedum parenti,
defensionem tribuendam '. This use, in an affirmative clause, seems
to occur first in Livy (ix 18, 4).

consulem designatum: ch, 5, 3.

qui obsignarent, ‘ who were to sign the marriage contract ’.

velut suscipiendorum liberorum causa: words to this effect
would form an essential part of the marriage contract.

velut: used like ὡς with a participle, Intr. II 50, a.

auspicum verba: cf. ‘missi auspices' (to the bride), xv 37, 93
‘ veniet cum signatoribus auspex ⁹, Juvenal, Sat. x 336. The signing
of the marriage contract‚ and the announcement by ‘auspices’
that the omens were favourable, would form part of the marriage
ceremony held at the bride's house, before the ‘deductio’ to the
bridegroom’s home. Anciently nothing of any importance was
done without taking auspices, but by this time the taking of
auspices was ordinarily represented at the marriage ceremony by
the repetition by some of the friends present of a formula pro-
nouncing good luck.

subisse: the word seems to refer to some phrase used in the
course of the marriage ceremony, perhaps that for entering the
door) of the husband's house; cf. ‘subi forem', Catullus lxi 168

161 . r
( discubitum: sc. ‘ ab ipsis ’, ‘they took their places ’.

oscula complexus: sc. ‘fuisse '.

§2. senioribus: dat. of agent. Intr. II 10.

The description of Messalina’s marriage with Silius should be
compared with Juvenal, Sat. x 329 and foll.
