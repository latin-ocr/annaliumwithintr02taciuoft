BOOK XII, CH. 58, ξ 2—-CH, 60, ἐξ 1-5

terms of the decree are not known; but at a later date we find
the civil jurisdiction of the procurator, in cases between the ‘fiscus '
and private persons, concurrent with and practically superseding
that of the proconsul.

§3. equestres: here equivalent to ‘equites ’. The ‘ praefectura
Aegypti ’ and ⁴ praefectura praetorii ’ were the two most important
offices open to knights. The former involved the command of two
legions, and other troopS. The language of the section marks the
difference between even the highest of the emperor’s ‘praefecti ⁹
and the elected magistrates.

concessa sunt: sc. ⁴ praefectis ’.

praetoribus: the word applies to the governors in the provinces
as well as the praetors at Rome.

noscebantur: for ‘cognoscebantur '‚ cf. lntr. II 28.

§4 There is a confusion of thought in this passage. The privi—
lege at issue in the contests of ‘equites’ and senate under the
Republic was that of furnishing the jury in the criminal ‘quae-
stiones perpetuae’; the question now dealt with is that of the
jurisdiction of an individual procurator, usually of equestrian rank,
without a jury, in civil actions between the princeps and individuals.

omne ius, &c.‚ ‘put into their hands the whole jurisdiction
which had been so often the cause of party—strife or civil war ’.

Semproniis rogationibus: pl. for sing. ; the reference being to
the law of Caius Gracchus in 122 13.c.

Serviliae: probably also pl. sor sing. The law of Servilius
Caepio, consul in 106 B.C., which aimed at restoring to the senate
the control of the ‘iudicia ³, does not seem to have been carried.
His proposal had been vehemently opposed by another Servilius,
namely Glaucia, who was tribune in 106 Β. (3., and a few years later
the confederate of Saturninus.

Marius et Sulla: Tacitus' account is here misleading. The
question upon which these two came into conflict was that of
the command against Mithridates, in 88 B.c., when the tribune
P. Sulpicius Rufus carried a measure in the comitia giving it to
Marius, although the senate had already appointed Sulla. Of
course, the parties to which Marius and Sulla belonged held
opposing views as to the constitution of the ‘iudicia', and in
his dictatorship Sulla ordained that the ‘iudices ‘ should be taken
from the senators instead of equites. It may be noticed that
Tacitus omits mention of the ‘lex Aurelia’ of 70 B.c.‚ passed in
the consulship of Pompey and Crassus, by which ‘iudices ’ were to
be taken from senators, equites, ancl ‘tribuni aerarii', and of the
final constitution of the ‘ iudicia' by Augustus.

ξ 5. sed, &c.‚ ‘but in those days the rivalry was one os whole
classes, and what either side carried had the force of constitutional
practice'; whereas now the power of the freedmen was a matter of
personal influence and the pleasure of the princeps. ,

C. oppius et Cornelius Balbus: for the latter cf. xi 24, 4. His
career as ‘eques ⁹, before promotion to consulship and the senate,
