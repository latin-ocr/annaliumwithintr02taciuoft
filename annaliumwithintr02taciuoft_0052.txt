INTRODUCTION

in the provinces were checked; liberality was shown to foreign
subjects when in difficulty, as in the case of the bounties given to
the cities of Asia when ruined by earthquakes (ii 47), and the grati-
tude of provincials, attested by temples and monuments in foreign
countries, should be set against the complaints of nobles that liberty,
which to them meant the licence to plunder‚ had been destroyed.

It is not the purpose of this essay to represent Tiberius as an
ideal monarch; at his best, he did not rise above the level osa
sound administrator3 his reign is barren of great improvements or
extensions of the imperial system ; but it is desirable to give some·
indication of the points where Tacitus’ prejudices lead to misrepre-
sentation. Absolute power too often proves a burden beyond the
power of human nature to support, and the words of Arruntius
(vi 48), that Tiberius' character had broken down under the strain
of it, offer a view more reasonable than that suggested by Tacitus.
Tiberius was not strong in the qualities of courageous independence
or quick and resolute decision 3 as age weakened him, his mother’s
strong will no longer exercised upon him its influence towards
humane and moderate courses ; then came the shock of the sense
that the minister whom he had trusted had proved treacherous to
him; left isolated and suspicions, he lost his grip even on the
routine of administration, and came to see at every turn enemies
who must be struck down to make life safe for him.

ΤΙ-ΙΕ CHARACTER AND GOVERNMENT OF
CLAUDIUS

We have no complete account of Claudius' lise in Tacitus, whose
narrative is lost until we corne to the closing years of Claudius¹
reign, when he is represented as having sunk into a state of dotage, Ι
without will of his own, absent—minded and callous to the pitch of
imbecility, and entirely dominated by his wife and his freedrnen
ministers. From other writers, however, enough material can be
drawn to construet a fairly complete record of his life and character.
