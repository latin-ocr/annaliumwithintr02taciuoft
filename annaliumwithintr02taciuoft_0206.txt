TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

consultanti: dependent on the notion of speaking or answering
latent in ‘ permisit’.

flens, &cz Vitellius affected to believe that Asiaticus was
doomed‚ and begged for him permission to choose the mode of his
death, as if this would be a great famur Claudius was thus (l iverted
from 'his inclination to pity (ch. 2, 3), and he granted Vitellius'
request, as if the permission to commit suicide were an act of mercy.

Antonia: the younger daughter of Augustus’ sister Octavia by
Antonius the triumvir. She married Drusus, brother of the Emperor
Tiberius, and was mother of Germanicus, Livia (or Livilla), and the
Emperor Claudius. Antonia received the title of Augusta on the
accession of her grandson Gaius, but soon afterwards died or was
put to death.

observavissent: perhaps refers to the honours paid to her after
her death, not only to acts of respect during her lifetime.

recenti militia: he had probably been on the personal staff of
Claudius.

conciliandae misericordiae: a genitive of quality, Intr.1126,b.

permisit = ‘permittendum censuit’

in eandem clementiam: as if with ‘ spectantia’ ; ‘ the words of
Claudius which followed bestowed mercy in that very shape’.

ξ 2. inediam et lenem exitum. the latter expression is applied
to self- starv ation as not less painful but less violent than other forms
of suicide, and more resembling a natural death.

he would kill himself at once. For omission of ‘se ’ cf. Intr. II 3.

from choice. To such men were given important posts conferred
directly by the emperor, as the great ‘ praefecturae ' in Rome, and
that of Egypt.

quibus Petra cognomentum: more usually the gentile name ot
such persons is given as well. Possibly Tacitus here drew his
information from some unofficial narrative in which no other name
was g1ven.

professed charge.
