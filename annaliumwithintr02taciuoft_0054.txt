daughter os Octavia, the sister of AugustuS, and this alliance must
have improved his prospects os succession. Indeed, his sudden
elevation to the principate may well have been due to some pre-
concerted plan rather than the sudden half-humorous suggestion of
the soldiers who found him hiding in the palace on the day of Gaius’
murder. At any rate, the acts of the new government do not look
like those of persons taken unawares, and it is those measures of
Claudius' administration especially that fall in the early part of his
reign that manifest creditable statesmanship, either in himself or in
the advisers whom he had the good sense to follow.

Gaius had left the empire in a state of disorganization and con-
fusion. His maniacal extravagances had depleted the treasury and
brought the populace into the danger of famine,'while his oppression
had alienated the nobility and brought the principate into disfavour
with the upper classes. Abmad, Gaul had been pillaged, the
German tribes provoked to hostility, the jews in Palestine were on
the verge of rebellion, and in other regions, as Mauretania,
Commagene, and Parthia, disturbances had been caused by Gaius'
capricious interference with, or deposition of, native rulers.

The new administration proceeded to remedy these conditions‚
and showed a considerable measure of ability in dealing with the
task. The finances were reorganized 3 the lavish expenditure of
Gaius on shows and largesses was discontinued, and many of the
taxes imposed in the last reign could in consequence be remitted.
At this period we find the term ‘ fiscus ’ now first definitely applied
to the fund into which the revenues from the imperial provinces
went, and from which the expenses of their administration were met.
A difference no doubt had previously been drawn between this fund
and the income from the emperor's personal estates in different parts
of the empire, but both had been included under the term ‘ res suae ’
or ‘ res familiaris.' The ‘fiscus Caesaris’ now became a separate
and important department of the imperial administration‚ under the
charge of the ‘libertus a rationibus) This official, in origin one of
the servile staff of the emperor’s household, rose under Claudius to
increased dignity, which was enhanced by the prohibition of the use
of this name for the freedman holding the corresponding functions in
any other Roman household, Pallas, the ‘libertus a rationibus ’ under
Claudius, even received the insignia os the praetorship. Others also
