INTRODUCTION

in his history of Nero's reign, were M. Cluvius Rufus, a companion
of Nero in Greece, author of a history (probably) from Gaius to
Vitellius. Fabius Rusticus, one of Tacitus’ authorities for his treat-
ment of Britain (Agr. 10, 3), and the general Corbulo (xiii 20:
xv 16).

Other materials available for the Annals generally would be
biographies of famous men, such as that, produced later, of Thrasea
by Arulenus Rusticus, and those referred to by Tacitus as prece-
dents for his own work on Agricola (Agr. 1). From such a source
he probably drew his knowledge of the cases of victims of Tiberius,
which had been left unrecorded by his other authorities (see vi 7, 6).
There would also be funeral orations on public men, published
speeches, and collections of letters like that published later by the
younger Pliny. There were also the public records: ‘acta’ or
‘commentarii senatus' had been kept since the first consulship
of Julius Caesar, who at the same time also started the ‘ acta diurna
urbis‚’ the daily gazette chronicling proceedings in the courts and
chief events of public importance; and Tacitus made use of both ;
e. g. xv 74, 3; iii 3, 2. The events of which he wrote, too, were
sufficiently near to his own day for a considerable amount of tradi—
tion about them to be still existing and worth recording, as the
srequency of ‘ferunt,’ ‘traditur,' δια, before stories cited by him
indicates.

at the truth under the Einpire than under the Republic. Politics
were no longer for the general public3 in jurisdiction, in the
administration os the provinces, and in the conduct of war, much
was done by the princeps and his private advisers that could only
become known from official versions issued at the time, or from
such reminiscences as generals or imperial officials cared to publish
subsequently. Persons outside government circles remained at the
mercy of the official version : reminiscences of a general might be
mere sels-glorification. Tacitus believed himself to be writing
