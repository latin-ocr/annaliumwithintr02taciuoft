TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

aqua atque igni interdiceret: this sentence was one os
‘exilium ’, involving loss of property.

hactenus, ‘ thus far' (and no more). ‘Vitellius pressing for no
further penalty.’

Chapter 43, ξ Ι. prodigia: the mention of portents does not
occur in the earlier books of the Ammls, but from this point is fairly
common. Tacitus does not state what evils he regards these occur-
rences as foreshadowing; the famine is recorded as itself another
portent3 perhaps we are to infer that they presaged the troubles in
the East and the evils arising from the supplanting of Britannicus
by Nero.

diris avibus, ‘birds of ill—omen’. The sight of an owl in the
daytime was regarded as a specially bad sign.

dum latius metuiturst as the panic spread’.

in Tacitus; 0 g. xiv 18, 2 ‘agrorum quos. ‚proximus quisque pos-
sessor invaserant'.

ξ 2. iura reddentem: cf. Intr. pp. xxix, lii.

destia ' occurs in Pliny (N. H.). Cf. also ⁴ saevitia annonae’,

§4 nec nunc infecunditate laboratur, ‘its troubles are not
even now due to any lack of fertility'. The decay of farming in
Italy, ascribed by Varro to the preference by the peasantry of an
idle life in Rome, by Pliny to the prevalence of ‘latifundia' and
slave labour, was perhaps principally due on the economic side to
the fact that grain imported frorn Africa and Sicily cost less than
that raised in Italy.

Africam et Aegyptum: Josephus represents Herod Agrippa as
saying that Rome was supported by Egypt for four months in the
year and by Africa sor eight (B. J. ii 16, 4).

,δ 3. patrias, ⁴ native ' accomplishments‚ i. e. riding and archery.

§4 modicum, ⁴ inconsiderable as it was ’ ‚implying that if only
it was in his hands he would extend it.

detineri, ‘was being kept from him’ ; cf. xiv 651 (where
Nero is stated to have brought about the death of Pallas)‘ quod
mmensam pecuniam longa senecta detineret'.

ptum ultioni ⁹, xi 32, 1.
