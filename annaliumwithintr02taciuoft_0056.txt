former, the last of the three eagles taken from Varus in 9 A. D.
was recovered, as well as some captives surviving from his· army ;
and in dealing with the Chauci great success attended the opera-
tions of Corbulo (xi 18-20). The Roman garrisons were, however,
drawn to the Gallie side of the Rhine, and attempts to annex
the country to the east of the river were forbidden, in accordance
with the precept of Augustus, though some of the German tribes
nearest the Rhine acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome, and a strip
of territory on the right bank was kept clear of Germans, and
reserved for the use of the Roman troops (xiii 54, 2).

Claudius' chief military exploit, the invasion of Britain and re-
duction of a considerable part of it into a province, is described in
a separate chapter (p. lx).

An important feature of Claudius' reign is the foundation of
Roman colonies in the provinces, of which the most famous were
Colonia Agrippinensis (Cologne) and Camulodunum (Colchester) ε
in Noricum, too, five ‘ municipia’ are mentioned by the elder Pliny
as owing their status to the favour of Claudius. Seneca, in his
satire on Claudius, taunts him with the indiscriminate bestowal
of Roman citizenship upon provincials, but there is no positive
evidence that this was really done on any large scale. Seneca
probably exaggerates the effect of Claudius' admission of eminent
Gauls to the Senate and magistracies in Rome. This concession,
expressed in the oration of Claudius, of which a fragment has been
found in an inscription at Lyons, and the gist of which seems to
be condensed in Tacitus’ report in xi 24, was a natural development
of the policy pursued towards the chiefs of Gaul by both Augustus
and Tiberius, who by honouring and trusting them as far as possible
had sought to attach them firmly to their connexion with Rome.
These chiefs already possessed the Roman citizenship, and the
status of ‘equites’3 they now received the ‘right of the broad
stripe,' entitling thern to a seat in the Senate and to stand for
the Roman magistracies. This wise and liberal measure was
viewed with jealousy and alarm by the Roman nobles, and it was
to such seelings that Seneca appealed in the reference] which he
made in his satire to Claudius’ indulgence towards the provincials.

A general review, therefore, of Claudius' administration shows it to
contain many favourable features. But it would be a mistake to lose
