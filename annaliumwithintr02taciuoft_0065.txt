PARTHIA AND ARMENIA

the pro-Parthian, faction, and Gaius, irying to enfin-ce his creation
of Ariobarzanes by attacking his opponents at Artagira, incurred
the wound which ended in his death in 4 ΑΛ).

We learn from the ‘ Monumentum Ancyranum ’ that when Ario-
barzanes died, the Armenians rebelled against his son, another
Artavasdes, and killed him, on which Augustus nominated as their
king the Tigranes who is mentioned in vi 40, 2. This Tigranes,
however, was not able to maintain his position, and Erato became
queen again, but not for long; the throne remained vacant until
Vonones, driven from Parthia by Artabanus in 10 or 11 A.D., was
for a short time accepted as their king by the Armenians.

This Vonones was one of the sons of Phraates who, as was men-
tioned above, had been sent to be brought up at Rome. Phraates
had been murdered, and his throne taken, by his natural son
Phraataces, about 2 B.c.: he was followed by Orodes, who was
assassinated in 7 or 8 A.D., and then the Parthian nobles applied to
Augustus to send them one of Phraates’ sons, and it was in response
to this that Vonones was made king of Parthia. But his Romanized
ways made him unpopular with the leading nobles in his own coun-
try ; a plot was sormed against him, and Artabanus was made king
in his stead‚ in 10 or 11 A.D. This man on his mother’s side was
os the royal family of the Arsacidae, but on his father's side probably
a Dahan (see vi 42, 4; 36, 5).

Artabanus enjoyed a long reign, ruling till 40 A.D., and soon after
his accession insisted on the Romans withdrawing their support
from Vonones. The latter was removed from Armenia, and given
a home in Syria: but, at the time of Germanicus' mission to the
East, in 18 A.D., he was sent away to Cilicia in deference to Arta—
banus' wishes, and, attempting to escape back to Armenia, was
killed by his Roman guards.

Germanicus received from Artabanus a renewal of the agreement
of Parthia with Rome, and, proceeding into Armenia, instituted on
the throne Zeno, son of Polemo king of Pontus, a prince who was
the object of the national choice of the Armenians, and who now,
under the name of Artaxias, held till his death, some sixteen years
later, the throne which had stood vacant since the removal of
Vonones. During this tirne there are no troubles recorded between
Rome and Armenia, but by the time of the death of Artaxias,
