INTRODUCTION

For the events of the invasion we have only the narrative in Dio,
meagre in detail and vague in its geography. It appears that the
British resistance was headed by Caratacus and Togodumnus‚ who
had lately succeeded to their father’s kingdom. Early in the cam-
paign a tribe called the Boduni submitted‚ and received a Roman
garrisonzin their midst. Then the Roman army in its onward march
had to fight a two-days battle for the passage of a river¹ which
barred their way, after which the barbarians fell back north of the
Thanies‚ where they still threatened a vigorous resistance under
the leadership of Caratacus, Togodumnus having fallen.

Plautius halted on the bank of the Thames, where he waited for
the emperor to come with reinforcements, no doubt occupying
the interval in settling the districts through which he had
marched. When Claudius arrived, the Roman army crossed the
Thames, defeated the Britons and marched on to the chief city of
the Catuvellauni, Camulodunum, which they occupied. Caratacus
escaped, and we find him a few years later the leading spirit in the
resistance of the Silures; but his dominion passed into the hands
of the Romans, and in other places British princes made their
submission. Among these was Prasutagus, king of the Iceni, who
made a treaty with the Romans which would secure the new
province from attack from the north3 while in the south-east a
native prince Cogidubnus was entrusted with a kingdom extending
over the Regni (in Sussex) and including the town at Chichester.

In the remaining three years of his command, Plautius com-
pleted the subjugation of Cunobelinus' kingdom, while to Vespasian
was given the task of settling its western portion. By V espasian's
operations the country from Hampshire‚ including the Isle of Wight
(Vectis), was subdued as far as the Mendips ; so that now the new
province of Britain may be regarded as that part of England which
lies south of a line from Gloucester to Colchester. These two
places would be the main fortified camps on the frontier; Verulamium
would be an intermediate post; and Londinium a place of support
in the rear.

We recover the narrative of Tacitus for the events in Britain from

¹ This was probably the Medway. The Romans would have lauded on

the coast of Kent, and their march would be directed towards the Thames,
with Camulodunum as their ultimate goal.
