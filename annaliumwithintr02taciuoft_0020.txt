13 [24]. The Ablative of Place Whence is used freely, without
preposition, both os proper names: Etruria Lucaniaque et omni
Italia in senatum accitos, xi 24, 2 ; and of common names : or'dine
senatorio movetur, xii 4, 43 often also after compound verbs imply·
ing separation : depromptum sinu, vi 40, 1 ; so also, probably, exutum
campis, xii 45, 3.

14 [25]. The Ablative of Place Where is used, without preposi-
tion‚ as sreely as in poetry : domibus, vi 3, 3 ; terra caelove, vi 33, 3;
campo, xii 36, 4.

15 [26]. The Ablative of Time may denote a whole period
during which something took place (a post-Augustan use) : bellis
civilibus, vi 11, 3; duodecim annis, vi 51, 4; secutis diebus, xi 38, 3.
On the other hand, the preposition ‘ in ' is sometimes used to denote
a point or a period of time z eo in tempore, xi 29, 1.

The following ablatives also may be referred to this heading,
as denoting the occasion at which something happens: solita con-
vivio, xi 38, 2 ; proelio solita, xii 56, 2 ; prosperis dubiisque sociam,
xii 5, 3.

16 [27]. The Instrumental Ablative is used of persons, where
the fact of the presence of a person, rather than the personality
of the agent, is emphasized: Tiridates simul fama atque ipso
Artabano perculsus, vi, 44 3.

This case is also used to describe the force with which military
operations are conducted, like the Greek αἴρειν στρατῴε multis
equitum milibus in castra venit, vi 37, 43 multa manu . . . adven-
tabat, vi 44, 3.

17. Tacitus sometimes affects the poetical collocation of an ablative
of ‘ Respect' with an adjective, as editam loco, xii 16, 33 rudem
iuventa, xii 15, 1. (Cf. such expressions as curvam compagibus
- alvom, Verg. Aen. ii 51 ; saeva sonoribus arma, Aen. ix 651.)

18 [29]. The Ablative of Quality is used without the association of
a common noun (such as ‘ vir ’) : truci eloquentia habebatur, vi 48, 6 3
et quidam summis honoribus, vi 9, 5 ; Cotta Messalinus . . ,
inveterata invidia, vi 5, 1. Sometimes the epithet is omitted:
