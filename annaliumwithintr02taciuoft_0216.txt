TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

use of letters in Etruria later than in Latium. It is far more likely
in fact that the alphabet existed in both districts from a very early
date 3 see Mommsen, Hz'st. i, ch. 14.

Aborigines: this name is given to the early Latins by Livy
(i 1, 5) and other writers.

Evander: mythical founder of the ancient ‘Pallanteum’ on the
Palatine (Verg. Aen. viii 81 and soll.). The artos writing was no
doubt introduced among the Italians by the Greeks, and Evander is
to Latium, as Demaratus to Etruria, the representative in legend of
prehistoric Greek influences.

Cumae, colonized as early as the eighth century B. C., is a
probable source of the spreading of writing.

forma, &c. : so also Pliny (N. [ἶ. νίἰ 58, 210).

paucae primum: an overstatement. The known additions are
not numerous. Cicero (N. D. ii 37, 93) speaks of the alphabet in
his time as consisting of twenty-one letters. Of these, g(existing in
the earliest Scipionic inscription (circ. 290 B.C.)) is said by Plutarch to
have been introduced by Sp. Carvilius; this would be in the time os
the First Punic &Van Also x, though found in the earliest extant
writing, was not in universal use, and cs was often used for it. Its
position at the end of the proper Roman alphabet suggests that it
was added to the earliest system, or perhaps restored after a period
of disuse. In Cicero’s timey and Ζ came into use, but were restricted
to Greek words. A passage in Suetonius (Aug. 88) shows that x
was regarded as the last letter of the true alphabet.

ξς. Claudius' additions were the symbols J for the semi-con-
sonantal v, ) (antisigma) for ps or bs, f (the Greek sign for the
‘ spiritus asper ') for the y sound intermediate between ἱ and u. Of
these new signs the first was employed fairly frequently for a time,
but the last two very seldom.

publico † dis plebiscitis: the reading is questionable‚ and the
fact of ‘ plebiscita' being passed under the Empire is not undisputed
(see ch. 13, 2); otherwise ‘publicandis plebiscitis ’ might seem a
satisfactory emendation. The doubtful words ‘dis ’ and ‘plebiscitis'
may be glosses to explain ‘per fora ac templa', interpolated from
the margin into the text.

Chapter 15, ξ 1. super collegio, ⁴ about the establishment of a
college '. An ‘ ordo haruspicum Augustorum ⁹, apparently of sixty
members, is mentioned in an inscription belonging to this period,
and was probably established as a result of this motion. ‘ Haru-
spices ’,though honoured in Etruria, were in Rome much inferior to
the augurs, who formed one of the great priestly colleges of men of
the highest rank. A magistrate’s haruspex ranked only with his
apparitors, and Cicero (ad Fam. vi 18, 1) considers it an indignity
that persons who had been haruspices had in his day become
senators.

accitos: from Etruria, the home of the science of ‘haruspicina ’.

habitas, ‘ kept up ³.

patrum Romanorum impulsu: Cicero mentions a ‘senatus
