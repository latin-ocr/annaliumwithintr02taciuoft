INTRODUCTION

100 Α.Ι).1 This is the last fact in his life definitely known, and
there is no evidence that he outlived Trajan.

ξ 2. The Amzals, more properly entitled ‘Libri ab excessu divi
Augusti,’ comprising in sixteen Books the history of fifty—four
years from the death of Augustus to that of Nero, are the latest

in date of his writings‚ and are shown by an allusion to the '

Eastern conquests of Trajan (ii 61, 2) to have been published
at some date not earlier than 115 A.D., and probably before the
retrocession of the Eastern frontier under Hadrian in 117 A. D.
The first six Books, comprising the principate of Tiberius, rest on

a single manuscript, called the First Medicean, written prob· =
ably in the tenth or eleventh century, ancl now preserved at γ

Florence. The text of Books xi-xii, given in this volume, is

based on a MS. known as the Second Medicean, which contains -
all that we have of Books >ti—xvi, besides all the extant part of ’

the Histories‚ with the exception of i 69-75 and i 86—ii 2. It is
known to have been sent from Florence to Rome in 1427 A.D.‚
but it was shortly afterwards returned to Florence, where it passed
to the Convent of St. Mark‚ and thence to the Laurentian Library,
where it still remains. Other existing MSS. cannot be proved
to be of earlier date, and are generally regarded as based, if not on
the Medicean MS. itself, at any rate on the same source as that from
which it was taken, their variations being either attempted emenda-
tions or preserving the right text in places where the original letters of
Med. have become illegible and been reproduced by a later hand.

Materials available to Tacitus.

ξ 3. It is not Tacitus' usual practice to give the names ‚of the
authorities whom he followed, and in the case of the first six Books
of the A nnals he does so only twice, mentioning the history of the
German wars by C. Plinius, in i 69, 3, and the memoirs of the
younger Agrippina in iv 53, 3. In each of these cases it would
appear that he is here giving something overlooked by the other
authors whom he usually followed. As a rule his references are
