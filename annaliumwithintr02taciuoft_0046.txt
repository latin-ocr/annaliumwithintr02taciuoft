INTRODUCTION

that he had been poisoned, but the evidence for this broke down
completely. Piso, who had thwarted Germanicus by all means in
his power when in the East‚ was put on trial for his misbehaviour,
and felt so sure of condemnation that he committed suicide ; there
was a rumour that his interference with Germanicus had been
prompted by Tiberius (iii 16), but Tacitus does not vouch for it
as a fact. We can believe that Tiberius had no great affection for
Germanicus, whom at one time he must have regarded as a possible
rival, and whose wife, Agrippina, was of an aggressive disposition
and personally obnoxious to him3 there is absolutely no evidence,
and not much likelihood, that he schemed his destruction. It is
possible that he put Piso in charge of Syria, during Germanicus’
mission to the East, knowing him to be a man of independent
character, and wishing that there should be some counterpoise to
Germanicus' power : he did not, however, foresee the lengths
to which Piso, through sheer personal dislike of Germanicus, would
carry his opposition, and he showed no signs of condoning Piso's
actions or attempting to shield him, but solemnly charged the Senate
at his trial to sift the charges against him with the utmost impar-
tiality and without any consideration of what they might fancy to
be the emperor’s view of the case or his wishes in the matter
(iii 12).

It has been mentioned that Tacitus cited the cases tried under
the law of ‘ maiestas’ as the exeeption to the equitable administra—
tion of justice. It was under Tiberius that trials of this sort first
became frequent, and this is one of Tacitus’ strongest reasons for
his unfavourable view of him. The statute under which such cases
were tried was one capable of wide interpretation : Tacitus declares
that under the Republic, persons guilty00f treachery in the field or
sedition at home were actionable for ‘ maiestas,’ and that then
deeds alone, not words, made them liable (i 72, 2). As a matter
of fact, however, it was possible even under the Republic to prose-
cute under this count for libels and slanders: such a view is to be
seen in Cicero (ad Fam. iii 11, 2), and it was enforced by Augustus
in the case of libellous publications, though under him trials for
‘maiestas ' occurred but seldom. In the course of Tiberius' reign
there was a plentiful crop of prosecutions of this sort in which words
as well as deeds were charged, and there arose the odious profession
