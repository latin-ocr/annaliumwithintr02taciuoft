CLAUDIUS

We gather that in infancy ancl childhood Claudius suffered a succes—
sion of illnesses, which so intensified his natural desects that he was
kept in the background and regarded with aversion and contempt
even by his mother. While his gifted brother Germanicus was
rapidly advanced to honour and office, Claudius remained in ob—
scurity. Under Augustus he received nothing higher than an augur-
ship, and under Tiberius merely the ‘ consularia ornamenta,’ in spite
of his desire for the actual consulship. From early years, however, he
displayeda passion sor literary and historical studies : a long list of
his compositions is given by Suetonius, and in this field he was
not without ability. This is acknowledged by Augustus in a
letter to Livia which is quoted by Suetonius, who also tells us of
Augustus wondering how one who conversed so badly could declaim
so well. So also Tacitus says of him, ‘nec in Claudio quoties
meditata dissereret elegantiam requireres’ (xiii 3,6). His intellectual
pursuits‚ however, do not appear to have kept him from indulgence
in coarse pleasures, and Suetonius states that he spent his leisure
with low companions, in drinking, gambling‚ and debauchery. He
may be compared to James 1 of England, ‘the wisest fool in
Christendom,' full of eruditiori, but lacking force of character and
practical ability‚ ungainly, stammering‚ and undignified.

Under Gaius, Claudius, now in middle life, was promoted to
higher rank, becoming a senator instead of being merely an
equestrian, and receiving the consulship. But he suffered insults
and was exposed to danger3 he was reprimanded sor his acts as
consul and was asked his ‘sententia ’ in the Senate last of all the
‘ consulares '; at Court he was the butt of practical jokes inflicted
upon him by Gaius ancl his courtiers, and once, when sent on a
deputation to Gaius in Gaul, he carne near losing his life.

It is quite possible that during this period he may have purposely
exaggerated his eccentricities and submitted to the einperor’s
insults, finding it safest to be despised, while secretly looking sor-
ward to the time of his own accession. It was not likely that
Gaius’ tyranny would be endured sor any great length os time, and
by his connexion with the imperial house Claudius was the most
natural successor. And it was at this stage that he married Valeria
Messalina, a woman of higher rank than either of his previous wives,
Plautia Urgulanilla and Aelia Paetina, for she was a great-grand-
