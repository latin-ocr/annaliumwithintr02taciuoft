INTRODUCTION

xi 18, 13 some express ‘mannen' as non nulla spe et aliquando
ira, xi 37, 1; some are nearly ‘descriptive,' as actae principi
grates, quaesitiore in Domitium adulatione, xii 26, 1 ; suscipi bellum
avio itinere, importuoso mari, xii 20, 2; ignobilem Hiberum mer-
cennario milite disserebat, vi 34, 5, seems partly causal‚ partly
descriptive. (See also v 10, 23 vi 45, 5; xi 36, 43 xii 5, 1 ; xii 13,
3; xii 18, 1; xii 30, 4.)

(b) the ablative of gerund or gerundive, as the equivalent of a
present participle or temporalclause introduced by ‘dum’: adiciendo,
v 6, 5; ordiendo, vi 8, 1 ; obiectand0‚ vi 38, 23 ventitando, xii 3, 13
memorando, xii 44, 5.

I ) . Genitive.

23 [32]. Partitive and quasi-partitive genitives are abundant,
and osten there is no stress on the partitive notion, the phrase
becoming equivalent, as in poetry (e. g. strata viarum, in Lucretius
and Vergil), to a simple substantive and adjective.

(a) With neut. sing. : extremo anni, vi 27, 1 ; lubricum iuventae,
vi 49, 3 ; per medium diei, xi 21, 23 post multum vulnerum, xii 56,
5 ; medio diei, xii 69, 1.

(b) With neut. plur.: simulationum falsa, vi 45, 5; castellorum
ardua, xi 9, 1 3 incerta Oceani, xi 20, 2 ; montium edita, xii 56, 4.

(c) A substantive, accompanied by an adjective, is taken out of
its natural case, and put in the partitive genitive: cunctis civium, xi
22, 4 5 adversis proeliorum (= adversis proeliis), vi 36, 33 so, prob-
ably‚ provinciarum vectigalibus = the tribute-paying provinces, xi
22, 8.

(d) Such a genitive may stand without any word expressing
partition being expressed: Caninius Gallus quindecimvirum, vi
12, 1.

24 [33]. Objective Genitive.

(a) The elliptical genitive, common with verbs of accusing and
judging, is extended to new examples: postulare, vi 9, 5 ; repetun-
darum teneri, xi 7, 8 ; urgere (if the reading is sound), vi 29, 3.

(b) It is frequent with participles, as retinens, v 11, 2; cupiens,
vi 46, 2 ς casus prioris impatiens, xii 52, 1.
