TIBERIUS

, throne of Armenia. After this he was constantly employed by
Augustus in his great work of securing the northern frontiers of the

, empire. In 15 Β. C.‚ being in command among the Helvetii, he

emperated with his brother Drusus in the subjugation of the tribes
to the north of Italy, bringing Rhaetia and Vindelicia under the
Roman rule. Then, from the years 12 to 10 B.c.‚ he conducted
three campaigns in Pannonia, the effect of which was to secure the
frontiers of the Illyrian province. After this, upon the death of
Drusus in Germany in 9 Β. C.‚ he took up the work of the extension
of Roman influence in that quarter, and brought the tribes between
the Elbe and the Rhine into submission. All this was work that
» only a general of real capacity and energy could have accomplished
with success, and Augustus showed how much he valued his powers
by associating him in the ‘tribunicia potestas' sor five years from
6 Β. C.‚ and by sending him out again from the years 4 to 11 Α. D.‚
when serious troubles again broke out in (jermany and Pannonia.
But in spite of this career of honour the circumstances of his
private life were not happy: he was exposed to sorrows and disap-
pointments that must have soured his character. He was treated
by Augustus as a useful instrument for forwarding the imperial
policy and was honoured as such3 but to the emperor's convenience
his own personal inclinations must always be subordinated. About
15 Β. c. he was married to Vipsania, daughter of Agrippa, but soon
after Agrippa‘s death, in 12 ss.c., he was forced to put away the wife
for whom he had a deep affection, and to marry Julia the daughter
of Augustus, Agrippa’s widow. In regard to the succession, too,
his position was unsatisfactory. Had Augustus died at this stage,
he would have been content that Tiberius, a man of tried ability
and experience, should be his successor. But when Tiberius
returned from his work in· Germany, it became evident that it was
Augustus’ ambition that his heir should be one of his own blood,
and that he would be found in the person of one of his grandsons,
Gaius, or Lucius, Caesar, who were now respectively thirteen and
ten years old. Tiberius, then, after spending his best energies in
Augustus' service and sacrificing his own domestic happiness at the
emperor’s bidding‚ found that he must now yield up the prospect of
further advancement to his young rivals. Realizing this, and dis-
gusted at Julia’s infidelities‚ he resolved to retire from public lise,
