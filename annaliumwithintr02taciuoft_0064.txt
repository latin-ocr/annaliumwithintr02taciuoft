have made Armenia a province he preferred to restore it to a native
prince (Mon. Anc. v 24-8).

The settlement with Parthia proved fairly satisfactory. Phraates,
Tacitus declares (ii 1, 2), hencesorth showed marks of service and
respect to Rome, and ten years later he sent his children to be
brought up in Rome, an act which was os high importance, as pro-
viding a supply of Romanized princes for future vacancies on the
throne of Parthia.

In Armenia, the rule of Tigranes seems to have been of but short
duration. Evidently there was a strong body os resistance to Roman
intervention, and it seems that, in spite of Augustus' agreement with
Phraates, the anti-Roman factions in Armenia could obtain Parthian
support. There were successive revolutions and changes of mon-
archs, the record of which is fragmentary and the chronology defee-
tive. It seems that Tigranes’ rule soon came to an end, and then
his son and daughter, Tigranes and Erato, married in the fashion
of Oriental royalties‚ reigned as king and queen. They seem to
have had support from Parthia, to the detriment of Artavasdes ¹,
whom the Romans famured, and who for a short time took the
throne at Augustus' bidding‚ but was again driven out, probably by
Tigranes and Erato, on which occasion a number of Romans lost
their lives (ii 4, 1). This may be the crisis which Tiberius was
invited to go and settle, in 6 B.C.‚ when he refused, insisting on
going into retirement at Rhodes instead.

The situation in Armenia was not dealt with until 3 or 2 B.C.‚ when
Augustus began negotiating with the Parthians in protest against
their intrigues in Armenia. About this time Artavasdes died, and
then Tigranes requested Augustus to agree to his tenure of Armenia.
Augustus told him to apply to Gaius Caesar, who was sent out to
deal with affairs in the East in 1 B.C. ; but before the meeting took
place Tigranes died in a battle ‘ with barbarians ' (Dio, lv 10, a), and,
Erato abdicating, Gaius had to choose a new king. He appointed
Ariobarzanes king of Media, son of the Median Artavasdes (see
p. lvii), with the consent of the Armenians, as Tacitus states (ii
4, 2), but this consent was probably limited to the Romanizing
party in Armenia, and there was armed opposition from the other,
