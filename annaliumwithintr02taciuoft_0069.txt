CONQUEST OF BRITAIN

47 Α.1)., when P. Ostorius Scapula succeeded Plautius, but the
subject is not presented in clear detail, and only a rough summary
of the events can be made. On his arrival, the new legatus had to
deal with raids upon the new province from the unsubdued parts of
Britain, and to check these he annexed a further portion from what
is now included in the Midland counties. This excited alarin
among the Iceni on the east, the Brigantes in the north, and the
Silures in the west; and in the last—named quarter a long and
bitter struggle began. The Silures had now for their leader the
fugitive Caratacus, and for three years he conducted a skilfu
resistance to the Romans in the counties along the eastem borders
of Wales. At the end of this period, in 51 Α. 1)., the strife was
ended by a great pitched battle (described in xii 33-35), the site of
which is a matter of conjecture (xii 33, 2). This resulted in the
complete defeat of the Britons‚ the capture of Caratacus' brothers,
and the subsequent surrender of the person of Caratacus himself.
But the resistance of the Silures was not finally overcome. A per-
manent camp for the Second Legion was now made at Isca Silurum
(Caerleon-on·Usk), and the position was maintained with difficulty
and at the cost of several reverses (xii 38-40). Moreover, the
hostility of the Brigantes now became acute, and one of their
princes, Venutius, carne to the front as the Britons' most skilful
national leader.

At an early stage in these renewed hostilities‚ Ostorius died, and
during the next six years, under the government of Didius Gallus
and then of Veranius, no accession of territory was effected, but in
all probability the administration and the defence of the districts
already gained were systematically organized‚ At the close ot
Claudius' reign, then, the condition of Roman Britain may be
briefly described as follows : Isca and Venta (Caerwent) were held
with strong garrisons as posts against the Silures; Viroconium
(Wroxeter)‚ against the Ordovices who occupied North Wales;
Deva (chester) and Lindum (Lincoln) confronted the Brigantes.
Each of these places (except Venta) was the head-quarters of a
legion, and all were connected with each other and with their bases
of support in the south—east by the Foss Way¹ and the Watling

¹ The Watling Street ran from London to Viroconium; the Foss Way
from Lindum to Aquae Sulis (Bath).
