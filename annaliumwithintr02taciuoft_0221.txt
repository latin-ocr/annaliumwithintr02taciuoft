referring to his own elevation, although he was a ‘ novus homo ’‚

praetulistis ⁹, Phil. vi 6, 17.

ᾗ 4. longa . . . senecta : abl. of description, followed, for
variety, by nominatives ‘adrogans ’, ‘difficilis ' ; note also the dat.

Chapter 22, ξ 1. nullis palam causis: Intr. II 49.

reperitur: according to Suetonius (Cl. 35), persons seeking
audience of the emperor at the morning ‘ salutatio ’ were searched
before admission.

δ 2. nam: this explains ‘neque cognitis’ above.

ξ 3. isdem consulibus: see ch. 11, 1.

P. Dolabella: prominent as a servile senator under Tiberius;
consul in 10 Α. D., and procos. of Africa in 24 A. D. His ‘ sententia '
was evidently taken up by Claudius, for the enactment is referred
to as among the ‘acta Claudii ’ in xiii 5, 2, and is ascribed to him
by Suetonius (Cl. 24).

eorum, &c.: i. e, the ‘quaestores designati ’; they were relieved of

‘aetas legitima’ sor the magistrates; by its regulations the mini-
mum age for quaestors was thirty-one, for aediles thirty-seven, for
praetors forty, and for consuls forty-three. These limits were
reduced under Augustus, and the ordinary age sor holding the

two quaestors to manage it. lt seems then that the ‘quaestores
parricidii ’ of the royal period acquired under the Republic additional
functions as ‘ quaestores aerarii '‚ and in time came to exercise the
latter functions only.

lex curiata: this was the act by which ‘imperium ' was conferi-ed
on magistrates after election. The ‘ comitia centuriata’ very early
