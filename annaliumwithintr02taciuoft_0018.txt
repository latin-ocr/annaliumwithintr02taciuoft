INTRODUCTION

An adjective sometimes stands in agreement with a noun or
pronoun to form a phrase which might have been expressed by
a clause with quod: as nihil. . . novum, xii 2, 13 nihil nisi atrox
. . . terrebat, xii 35, 13 nullae . . . litterae suspicionem dabant,
Vi 479 4·

3 (a) [8‚ 9]. Pronouns of the third person are omitted, especially in
the accusative, in spite of the harshness or obscurity involved.

Se is omitted in vi 48, 33 v 5, 2 ; and many other places noted in Ι

the6commentary. Eum is omitted in vi 46, 7 ; xi 4, 43 eam> in
xii .

(·b)5’'Il'³he indefinite quis is used in the phrase ut quis, for ut
quisque, vi 7, 4, and elsewhere.

..(⁶)6Q¹³i³ ille is used with a peculiar brachylogy in xi 7, 1:
κη 3 ‚ 2.

11. CASEs.

A. A ccusative.

4 [11]. The poetical or Greek accusative of the part concerned,
not frequent in prose, is freely used : clari genus, vi 9, 5 ς adlevatur
animum, vi 43, 3.

5 [10]. The accusative of the place towards which motion takes
place is found without preposition ε xii 31, 3 3 51, 4 (perhaps).

6 [12]. Transitive accusatives are used

(a) in apposition to the sentence, i. e. in explanation of the action
described, notos a single word in the sentence: auspicium prosperi
transgressus, vi 37, 23 terrorem, xii 29, 2 ; so, too (probably),
pretium festinandi, vi 29, 23 subsidium, xii 32, 4 ;

(b) after verbs expressing the feelings, as pavescere ;

(c) after compound verbs, where a dative or a repetition of the
preposition with its case would be more usual: (genua) advolvi,
vi 49, 33 accedere, xii 31, 33 erumpere, xii 63, 2 ; evadere, v 10, 4;
exire, vi 49, 3 3 praeiacere‚ xii 36, 4 ; praeminere, xii 12, 1 ; prae-
sidere, xii 14, 7.

7 [14]. The use of adverbial accusatives such as id temporis is
extended to new expressions, as id auctoritatis, xii 18, 1.
