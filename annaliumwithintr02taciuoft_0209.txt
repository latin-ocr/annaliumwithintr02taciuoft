BOOK xi, (ῙΗ. 5. ξ 3—CH. 7, Q< με

spe praesumat, ‘anticipate in hope ’.

§2 usui et rebus, ‘to meet the requirements and business os
life assistance is provided (by professional advocates), that none
may be at the inerey of the powersul forlack of men to defend him’.
Cf. xv 6,5 ‘ex rerum usu ', ‘in accordance with the sequit-emonis
os events ’.

ξ 3. gratuito contingere, ‘is attained without cost ’.

ut quis, ‘ in order that a man may devote himself to the affairs of
others’. ‘Ut quis’ may also mean ‘according as one', Sco, · cf.
iv 23, 6 ‘ut quis fortuna inops. ‚promptius ruebant’.

ξ 4. The two pursuits open to senators (who were debarred
from ordinary trade) are mentioned.

exercere agros: so used in xii 43, 4, and elsewhere in Tac.
So osten· in Verg. .‚ e. g. Aen. vii 798‘ exercent vomere colles’.
Atolerare vitam (also in xv 45, 6) is alsoa Vergilian phrase,

en vni 409.

nihil, &c. ., ‘no calling in life is adopted by any man without the
prospect of some remuneratior] from it ’. <Lit. ‘ except that of
which he has foreseen emoluments ’.)

§ 5. magnum animum induisse, ‘assumed a losty spirit’
(in not accepting fees for pleading).

ᾅ 6. P. Clodius, Ο. Curio: not creditable examples, for the
former is stated to have been bribed to commit‘ praevaricatio’ by
Catiline (Cic. de Harusp. Resp. 20, 42), and the corruption of the
latter b)y Julius Caesar is attested by Lucan (iv 819) and Suetonius
(lul. 29 .

ξ 7. modicos, ‘of moderate means’, with little more than the
bare senatorial census. Cf. ‘ modicis equitibus ', i 73, 1.

In reality Suillius (see xiii 43, 6) was very wealthy‚ and so pro-
bably were the others.

quieta re publica: i.e. while the State enjoyed freedom from
civil war, with its attendant confiscations and enrichment of partisans
of the victors.

cogitaret, δια, ‘ he should think of the plebeians who won dis-
tinction by practice in the courts ’.

toga, the emblem of peaceful civic life, may sometimes speci-
fically denote the pleader’s dress and functions; cf. ‘cedant arma
togae'‚ Cic.; ‘in toga negotiisque versantur ', Pliny, Ep. i 22, 6;
Martial‚ of Quintilian, ‘ Romanae gloria magna togae ’.

ξ 8. haud frustra, ‘not without grounds '.

Α dena sestertia: a considerable reduction. Samius had given

four times as much to Suillius (ch. 5, 2).

A further change was made at Nero’s accession, xiii 5, 1, when
apparently an advocate was forbidden to make a bargain for his see
before the trial. These regulations, however, did not stop the pay-
ment of advocates, and men like Eprius Marcellus and Vibius
Crispus made enormous fortunes (Dzal. 8, 2).

repetundarum tenerentur: the genitive is used on the analogy
of that with ‘arguere’ , ⁴ manifestus’‚ and the like. Intr. II 24.
