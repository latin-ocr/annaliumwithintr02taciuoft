BOOK ΧΠ CH. 63, 52—cn. 65, §5 1—3

§6- enimvero: laying stress on the strongest pomt os rivalry;
cf. ch. 34‚2 . Lepida had taken the boy into her house in his
infancy when his father died and his mother was in exile, and
had evidently been in close intimacy with him ever since that
time.

dare: sc. ‘quibat' , supplied from ‘nequibat'; so ‘potest' is
supplied from ‘non potest’ in xiii 56, 3 ‘deesse nobis terra in
vitam, in qua moriamur, non potest '.

Chapter 65, ξ 1. obiecta sunt: the trial appears to have
taken the form of one conducted before the family by Claudius
as its head. A trial os this nature is described in xiii 32, §§ 3, 4.
‘ Mors indicta' points to an autocratic decree rather than a judicial
sentence

devotionibus,‘ withincantations’ . ‘Devotio' was accomplished
by piercing or burning an effigy of the person practised against, or
by inscribing the name, with appropriate curses, on a tablet which
was then dedicated to the infernal deities.

parum coercitis, &c. : troops of armed and mounted herdsmen
were maintained by the great proprietors on their extensive grazing
grounds (‘ saltus ') in Apulia and Calabria. These were always liable
to take to brigandage, · they had provided Catiline with recruits in
63 Β. C. ;and under Tiberius a quaestor was stationed in South Italy
to superintend police measures against them.

ξ 2. prompsisse, ⁴ to have declared’.

eeu Britannicus, &c.. he had destroyed the mother of the
former, and opposed the mother of the latteyr (ch. 2, soli), so that he
was sure of the dissavour of both.

ξ 3. convictam, διας xi 26-38.

pares, &c.‚ ‘there were equally strong grounds sor bringing an
accusation (of conspiring against Claudius) a second time, should
Nero become emperor; but is Britannicus were the successor, the
emperor need have no sear ’. The Latin is generally regarded as
unsatisfactory, as the sense seems to be spoilt by the clause ‘si
Nero imperitaret’; the object of bringing an accusation against
Agrippina and Nero would naturally seem to be to frustrate their
sehemes against Claudius and Britannicus; if Nero were on the
throne, the time for denunciation would be gone. Most commenta-
tors propose to delete either the whole, or some part of the words
from‘ si ’to‘ at’; but‘ novercae 'follows more naturally if ‘ Britan-
nico’ is retained, and a removal of any part of the sentence‘ si . . .
metum’ destroys the balance of the whole. Perhaps the confusion
of thought in the sentence as it stands is due to the excitement
under which Narcissus is represented as speaking, · or perhaps we
may take it that Narcissus meant, ‘ If Nero were to become em—
perot, then there would be justifiable cause for another p9rosecution
(against those guilty of conspiracy against Claudius)’; such a
prosecution would indeed be too late to save Claudius' lise, but
Narcissus naturally would not emphasize that fact too strongly out
of deserence to the emperor.
