his confidants, by working on his sears, to procure the destruction
os those whose wealth excited their greed or whom they wished to
remove sor their own ends. A conspiracy against the emperor’s
life, detected in the second year of his reign, was met by wide-
spread executions, directed at their pleasurc by the freedmen and
Messalina3 and the latter in particular was ever ready to com-
pass the death of those who disdained her advances or crossed
her path in any way. The early chapters of the eleventh book
present a case, typical probably of many others, in which, to
gratisy her jealousy and satisfyher cupidity, four lives were sacrificed,
the emperor was subdued to her will against his own inclinations,
and men of the highest rank combined to contrive charges to
coerce the emperor’s judgement.

In recording the final event in Messalina's career of unbridled
proffigacy, the bigamous marriage with Silius, from which her own
destruction resulted, Tacitus assures us that he has added nothing
to the accounts of the authorities whom he followed (xi 27). The
tale seems incredible indeed, but there are difficulties hardly less
great in the variant mentioned by Suetonius, but rejected by him,
to the effect that Claudius was a consenting party to Messalina’s
going through the form of marriage with Silius, in order that the
ill effect of an omen portended to ‘the husband of Messalina’
might be averted from himself. This version leaves it unexplained
how Narcissus had the power to turn the emperor's fears towards
the political dangers of the new marriage almost immediately aster
he had been induced by his superstitious fears to consent to it,
and whether the eminent and contemporary authorities whom
Tacitus followed were ignorant of, or suppressed, so important a
feature in the story as the emperor’s cognizance of the marriage.

In the closing period of Claudius' reign, after the death of
Messalina, the emperor is described by Tacitus as entirely domi-
nated by her successor Agrippina. She had a strong confederate in
the freedman Pallas, and won a position of even greater influence
than that held by Livia in the time of Augustus. She obtained,
as outward marks of her ascendancy, the title ‘Augusta‚’ and a
seat with the emperor on great public occasions (xii 37, 53 56, 5);
she amassed great wealth‚ procured the command of the prae-
torians for her own nominee (xii 42), and enabled her son by a
