TACITUS ANNALS : NOTES

formal, one os thern being this bestowal of the ‘imperium ’ on the
elected magistrates In the later times of the Republic the ‘comitia
curiata ' was represented by thirty lictors, with three augurs
resent.

p ab L. Bruto repetita, ‘dating back to L. Brutus ’. Tacitus
ascribes the form of words used at the ceremony conferring imperium
on the consuls to the original law of the traditional founder of the
Republic, by which the election of the first consuls was ratified and
their powers defined; and it is implied in the next sentence that
this old ‘lex’ empowered the consuls to appoint quaestors, as the
kings had done before them.

ξ 7. sexagensimo tertio anno: 447 B. C. The quaestorship had
been in abeyance under the Decemvirate, and now upon its re-
institution was transferred from consular nomination to popular
election in the ‘ comitia tributa ⁹.

ut, &c.: i. e. to »accompany the consuls to war, and take
charge of the military chest. ‘ Res militaris ' is analogous to ⁴ res
familiaris ¹.

ξ 8. duo additi, &oz according to Livy (iv 43, 4), the quaestors
were originally appointed for urban functions‚ and two additional
quaestors were instituted in 421 Β. C. to accompany the consuls
to war.

mox duplicatus numerus: in 267 B.C., when the subjuga-
tion of Italy was completed. The four new quaestors, called
‘quaestores classici', administered departments (‘provinciae') in
Italy. It is possible that one of these was transferred to Lilybaeum
after the annexation of Sicily, and that Tacitus refers to this in the
words ‘et accedentibus provinciarum vectigalibus ’. (For this ex—
pression cf. Intr. II 23, c.)

stipendiaria, διο, ‘ when Italy was now subject ⁵. The Italians
could not ever have been called ‘ stipendiarii ' in the sense in which
the provincials were3 most of their communities, however, would
naturally pay ‘ tributum ' (a tax on landed property) until its aboli-
tion in Italy after the conquest of Macedonia in 168 B.C.

339. lege Sullae: in 81 Β. C. Some addition to the number of
quaestors had probably been made already, as the number of
provinces rose.

Viginti : Julius Caesar subsequently raised their number to forty,
but Augustus seems to have reduced it to twenty again.

supplendo senatui: Sulla made the quaestorship the qualifica-
tion for entrance into the senate, the numbers of which he had
enlarged.

iudicia tradiderat: see xii 60, 4.

cui, ‘to whose members ⁹.

ξ 10. et: quamquam, ἃς. : i.e. the recovery by the equites of a
share in the ‘ iudicia ’ made it unnecessary to have so large a senate
and consequently so many quaestors to keep up its numbers:
however, the people did not wish to make that office harder to
obtain.
