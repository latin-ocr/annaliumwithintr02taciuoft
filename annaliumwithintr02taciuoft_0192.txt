TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

ἓιι. sine fraude, ‘harmlessi
5 indicium mortis, ‘sentence of death.

ξ 7. unus: there' 15 reason to think that even among those more
nearly related, the destruction was not so universal; for L. Seianus
is noticed by Dio as spared at the same time as Terentius (ch. 8).

Chapter 31, §L C. Cestius: see ch. 7, 3.

Μ. Servilius Nonianus: Tacitus records his death in the year
59 A. D. (xix 19), and speaks of 1115 celebrity as a historian in his
later years, after a successful forensic career.

Artabanus had taken possession of the throne of Parthia
about the year 11 A. D., expelling Vonones who had succeeded in
7 or 8 A. D. Artabanus sent enroys to Germanicus in 18 A. D., and
renewed with him the alliance of Parthia with Rome, and showed

’ marks of respect after Germanicus' death in 19 A. D. (ii 58 and 72).

ξ 2. aequabilis, ‘ without caprice ’.

Artaxias: he was the son of Polemo king of Pontus, and was
originally named Zeno, but took the name Artaxias at the ceremony
of his investiture as king of Armenia by Germanicus in 18 A.D.
(ii 56). His death is mentioned in this chapter as a recent occur-
rence, and may be attributed to 34 Α. D.

contumelia: the insult consisted not only in this demand itself‚
but in the other contents of the letter, in which Artabanus inveighed
against Tiberius as a murderer and debauchee, and called upon
him to commit suicide (Suet. Tib. 66).

a Vonone, &c : on his expulsion from Parthia (see above)
Vonones for a time reigned in Armenia, but was threatened by Arta-
banus, and the Roman governor of Syria, Creticus Silanus, removed
him f101n Armenia for 1116 sake of peace with Parthia, and detained
him first 1n Sy ria and then' m Cilicia; V onones attempted to escape
and was killed by a Roman veteran in 19 A. D. (ii 68).

veteres, &c.‚ ‘he spoke boastfully of the old boundaries of Persia
and Macedonia, and uttered vainglorious threats of overrunning
what first Cyrus and afterwards Alexander had held '. Such a claim
would comprehend Greece itself‚ as well as Syria and Asia Minor.

Cyro. A.lexandro: dative. Intr. II 10.

ξς). ae perinde opibus: supply ins ignibus’.

id, ‘this condition, 1 1Ζ. ‘ademptae virilitatis esse'.

ξ 4. Phraaten regis Phraatis filium· this would be one of the
four sons (of whom the Υ 01101165 of ξ 2 was another) sent by
Phraates 1V to Rome. Phraates IV ruled from 37 to 2 B. C. He
was the king who inflicted a reverse on Antony 111 36 Β. C„ and restored
the standards taken from Crassus to Augustus 111 20 B.C.· , the ces-
sion of his sons was made some time between 11 and 7 Β. C.

nomine, ἃς,ι 1116 (royal) name and the (imperial) sanction alone
were needed to ensure that there should be seen on the bank of the
Euphrates a descendant of Arsaces, there by Caesar’s will ³.

[The repetition of ‘ut'‚ if retained, serves to emphasize ‘sponte

Caesaris’ and ‘genus Arsacis’ as explanatory of ‘auctore’ and ’ ’

‘ nomine ' respectively, the terms being inverted by ‘ chiasmus’.]
