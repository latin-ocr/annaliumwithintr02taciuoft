§6. adductum, &c.‚⁸ hers was a strict‚ almost masculine, des-
potism'. ‘Adducere'= to draw tight, of reios, in contrast with
‘ remittere ’ = slacken. Cf. ‘ adductius regnari '‚ Germ. 44, 1.

nisi dominationi expediret, ‘except to secure her supremacy ’.
She was alleged to have purchased Pallas’ support by adultery
with him (ch. 25, 1).

by the presiding magistrate. He would be asked his opinion first,
as consul designate.
