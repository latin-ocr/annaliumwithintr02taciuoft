TIBERIUS

Tiberius’ reign (iv 6), this period is admitted to have been one os
good and upright administration. So sar, the Senate was continually
being consulted and was treated with respect; the Republican
magistrates continued to exercise their functions, and the worthiest
men were selected for office; in the provinces, cruelty and extor-
tion were repressed; at home, the laws, with the exception os that
dealing with ‘ maiestas‚‘ were uprightly administered ; in his private
lise the emperor was srugal and moderate, and disputes about
property between citizens ancl himself were settled in the ordinary
courts. For all this, however, Tacitus, in his final account of
Tiberius, allows him no credit at all: it is merely ‘a show of
virtue‚' hypocritically assumed, and mainly prompted by sear and
jealousy of his son Drusus and his nephew Germanicus.

Much, however, upon which Tacitus bases his strictures is
capable of a more favourable interpretation. Great stress is laid
on the hypocrisy of Tiberius’ professed diffidence in accepting
the principate at the outset. But it should be remembered that
there was as yet no precedent sor the succession of a ‘princeps‚⁵
and, to make the new ruler’s position that of a constitutional monarch
and not that of a despot, it was important to emphasize that his
elevation was by the full consent of the governed. This was what
the Senate’s invitation to Tiberius to take up Augustus’ powers
implied.

Neither is it fair to regard Tiberius' treatment of Germanicus as
attributable to none but jealous and malicious motives. Tiberius
actually strengthened the powers given to Germanicus by Augustus
(i 3, 5 ; 14, 4), and rewarded him with a triumph and the title of
‘ imperator' (i 55 3 58). His recall from Germany can be accounted
for on other grounds than the jealousy of the ‘ princeps ’ ; his expe-
ditions were not producing any real profit, but were on the contrary
inflicting severe burdens on Gaul (ii 5, 3), and Tiberius’ own
acquaintance with the conditions prevalent in Germany might well
justify his decision to discontinue further campaigns in that country.
Nor can Tacitus' statement be accepted that Tiberius sent Ger-
manicus to the East with the sinister intention of compassing his
destruction (‘amoliri specie honoris‚' ii 42, 1). There is no
evidence that Germanicus‘ death was due to other than natural
causes. Some indeed ascribed it to witchcraft! Others declared
