TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

die natali Augustae: this was Jan. 30.

novendialem. This name was given to a feast for the dead,
held on the ninth day after a funeral.

Μ’. Lepidus: see note on ch. 27, 4.

L. Arruntius: another eminent senator and pleader. He had
been mentioned by Augustus as a possible successor (i 13). He
was appointed in 15 A. D. as one of the commissioners whose duty
it was to prevent the ssooding of the river Tiber. In ch. 27 it is
mentioned that Tiberius prevented his tenure of the province of
Spain for which he was qualified. Chapters 47 and 48 record his
accusation and death in 37 A. D.

ξ 2. quae cuncta: possibly accusative as object of ‘revince-
batur’ used with the force of a middle voice.

simplicitas, ‘ frankness '.

in crimen duceretur: cf. xi 34, 2 ‘ quo ducerentur inclina-
tura ’.

Chapter 6‚§ 1. his verbis: the letter was probably extant in
the ‘acta senatus ³. Its opening words are quoted also by Sueto-
nius (Tib. 67).

ξ 2. ipsi quoque, i. e. ‘ ut et aliis tyrannis’ [or perhaps the words
mean that his wickedness brought unhappiness upon himself as well
as causing suffering to the victims of his cruelty].

praestantissimus sapientiae: for the genitive see Intr. 11 24, c.
The term is applied to Socrates in allusion to his having been
pronounced wisest of men by the Delphic oracle (Plato, Apol. v ad
fin). The sentiment quoted may be found in the Gorgias (524 E),
but the words ‘solitus est’ imply that more than one passage is
referred t0.

firmare: so in ch. 50, 53 see Intr. II 28.

malis consultis, ‘evil designs'.

ξ 3. fortuna, ‘rank', ‘position ⁹.

Chapter 7, ξ 1. C. Caeciliano: not known, apart from this

assage.
p prompserat, ‘had uttered ', ‘stated’ 3 so also xii 65, 2.

Aruseium et Sanquinium: these person5‚ and their accusation
of Arruntius, must have been mentioned in the lost part of the
Annals. Aruseius is, perhaps, again mentioned in ch. 40, 1 : this
Sanquinius is not the same as the person in ch. 4, 4.

nobilis: he was son of Messalla Corvinus (ch. 11, 4).

sanctissimis, διο, ⁶ was, by the honour of the vengeance exacted
for him, set on a par with the stainless accomplishments of Arrun-
tius '. The penalty inflicted on his accuser was probably exile.

ξ 2. Q. Servaeus: he had been the first governor of Commagene,
18 Α. D., and was one of the witnesses against Piso in 20 A. D.

Minucius Thermus: father, perham, of the praetor mentioned
in xvi 20, ε’, as victim of Tigellinus in 66 A. D.
