THE CAREER ANI) CHARACTER OF TIBERIUS

At the close of the sixth book of the Ammls, Tacitus gives his
view of Tiberius‘ career and character, the consideration of which
involves some account of his life as a whole, including the period
prior to that which falls within this volume.

Tacitus' estimate of Tiberius is wholly condemnatory. His
character is represented as bad and vicious, not allowed full play
while pressure of circumstances required its repression and while
his position was not absolutely secure. Towards the end of his life,
however, when all external restraints were removed, he is declared
to have corne out in his true colours as a monster of cruelty and
vice.

The facts of Tiberius’ early life make it evident that such a
description must not be accepted without qualification. Even
Tacitus does not refuse to him a measure of commendation in
regard to his early career, calling him ‘egregium vita famaque
quoad privatus vel in imperiis sub Augusto fuit‘ (vi 51, 5). Now
this period of his life extends to Tiberius' fifty-sixth year, an age by
which a person’s character is usually developed and can be seen in
its true nature. So far, however, no allegations of such debauchery
as is attributed to him at the close of his life by Tacitus can be
made 3 on the contrary, his character was by all accounts temperate
and austere 3 and the sentence just quoted invalidates the charge of
drunkenness made against him by Suetonius. The occupations,
moreover, in which these years were spent were not such as could
possibly have been given to, or undertaken by, a man of bad
character and vicious life. We find Tiberius all through this period
engaged in public affairs of great importance, and conducting thern
honourably and efficiently. He entered on the ‘cursus honorum,’
with Augustus’ sanction, at an earlier age than was customary
except for members of the imperial family, and when only twenty-
two years old received the important commission of settling the
affairs of the East, in 20 B.c., when, on the occasion of the Parthian
agreement with Rome, he received from Phraates the standards
captured from Crassus in 53 B.c.‚ and instituted Artaxias on the
