INTRODUCTION

Artabanus had abandoned his policy of deserence to Rome, and
now took occasion to challenge Rome’s direction of the succession
to the throne of Armenia by seizing it for his son Arsaces, arro-
gantly announcing his intention to reassert his authority as Parthian
monarch over all the possessions ‘once held by Cyrus and Alexander'
(vi 31).

The events which followed need not be further described here, as
the manner in which Tiberius dealt with the crisis is described
towards the end of Book vi (chaps. 31-44). Mithridates, estab-
lished hythe Romans as king of Armenia, was able to maintain
his position, and, before the death of Tiberius, Artabanus had been
forced by Vitellius to make submission and homage, and to deliver
his son as a hostage.

This settlement was upset by Gaius, who summoned Mithridates
to Rome and imprisoned him, leaving Artabanus once more master
of the situation in Armenia. However, on Artabanus’ death civil
war arose between his sons, and the whole Parthian empire was so
much disturbed by this that Claudius was able to reinstate Mithri-
dates in Armenia in the face of Parthian opposition, at some date
not later than 43 A.D. (xi 8).

For subsequent events in the East reference should be made to
the narrative in the text of Books xi and xii.

THE CONQUEST OF BRITAIN UNDER CLAUDIUS

The conquest of Britain had undoubtedly been regarded by Julius
Caesar as the natural complement os the subjugation of Gaul, since
Britain was a source of reinforcement to the Gallie resistance to
Rome, and Roman literature, about the time of the battle of
Actium, shows that there was then a general idea that Augustus
was meditating the achievement of this exploit as a legacy from
the divine Julius. But as time went on, Augustus dropped the
project : there was no serious danger now to be feared from Gaul,
and work more pressing occupied him nearer home. F riendly
relations, however, were secured by negotiation, and by the end of
