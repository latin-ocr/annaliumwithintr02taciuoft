TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

ξ 7. filius: his death, on a charge of conspiracy against Nero in
66 A. D.‚ is described in xvi 15.

servati civis decus: the ‘ civica corona ’.

Chapter 32, ξ 1. compositi, ‘ were quieted ' ; so in ch. 40, 1.

bellum inter: Intr. II 55.

in Decangos. Med. has ‘inde cangos ⁹.

Tacitus⁷ account, that the army reached a point near the Irish
Channel‚ and the indication that its operations provoked the hosti-
lity of the Brigantes (who lived north of the Mersey and the Humber
as far as the Solway and Tyne)‚ suggests that this tribe lived some-
where in the North of Wales. Pigs of lead have been found in
Cheshire and Staffordshire engraved DECEA‚ DECEANG, and DECE-
ANGI, and these are thought to have Come from the lead-producing
districts of Flintshire‚ probably on both sides of the Dee ς i. e. from
among the tribe here called ‘Decangi ’. It is a disputed point
whether DE, on the pigs‚ is part of the name, or a preposition. The
reading of Med. is in favour of the latter interpretation; but the
VVelsh name Tegenigl‚ still applied to the district between the Dee
and Clwyd, makes it probable that DE is the first syllable of the
name.

ξ 2. ausis aciem: cf. ch. 28, 1.

carpere, ‘to harass '3 so also in Caesar and Livy.

temptarent: subj. of repeated action, in a dependent clause.

ξ 3. destinationis certum, ‘ unwavering in his resolution ’ 3
Intr. II 24.

§ 4. arma coeptabant: so ‘coeptare seditionem ', i 38, 1.

Silures. These, with the kindred tribe Demetae west of them,
held a territory nearly corresponding to South Wales, Monmouth-
shire, and Herefordshire.

quin: following on the idea of ‘prevention ’ suggested by
‘ mutabatur ’.

§ 5. veniret = ‘eveniret ’. Intr. ΙΙ 28.

Camulodunum: Colchester, a town of the ‘ Trinobantes '. The
name is derived from the Celtic war-god ‘ Camulos ⁹. Tacitus does
not mean that a colony at Colchester would overawe rebel tribes in
the XYest ; but, to facilitate the transfer of the legions from Essex
westwards, a military colony was established at Colchester, which
now ceased to be a camp.

valida manu: abl. of quality.

inbuendis: dat. Intr. 11 11.

Chapter 33, ξ 1. Caratacus, one of the sons of Cunobelinus,
had no doubt been already mentioned by Tacitus in his account of
the invasion of Britain under Claudius. The name is connected
with the Celtic ‘ carat ² (= beloved)‚ whence ‘ Caradog’‚ ‘ Carthach’,
⁴ M⁰Carthy ’. The form ‘ Caractacus' is erroneous.

ambigua: the adjective is similarly contrasted with ‘prospera’
in xi 15, 2. ‘A long career, of varied peril and success! [The
ordinary meaning ‘ battles indecisive in result ’‚ as contrasted with
decisive defeats‚ is also possible.]
