to be 110 years (‘undenos decies per annos', Hor. C. S. 21), and
celebrations os the festival were attributed by them to the years
456, 346, 236, 126 B.C., so that 17 B.C. was the closing year of the
last ‘saeculum ’ in the series.

libris: the Historia, of which the extant portion (Books I—IV
and part of V) does not go beyond 70 A. D.

§3. is quoque, &c.: in 88 A.1).; Domitian followed Augustus’
view of the ‘ saeculum ⁹, but anticipated the full amount of the time
from Augustus’ celebration by six years.

intentius adfui, ‘ 1 was particularly interested in them '.

sacerdotio quindecimvirali: see vi 12, 1.

§4 iactantia: causal ablative.

ea cura, ‘ the quindecimviri (as a body) had of old the charge of
these games‚ and such of them as happened to be magistrates were
selected by preference (rather than others of the body) sor the
(public) performance of the religious duties’. Cf. Hor. C. S. 70
‘ quindecim Diana preces virorum curet '. In Augustus’ time, and
so also probably in that of his successms, there were five ‘magistri ’
among the ‘quindecimviri ’, of whom the emperor was one, and
it was in that capacity that he held the ‘ludi saeculares ’. With
these ‘magistri’ were also associated such others of the ‘quin—
decimviri ’ as were holding one of the higher magistracies.

§ 5. circensibus ludis: held on one of the days of the ‘ludi
saeculares ’.

ludicrum Troiae: evolutions such as those referred to in Vergil,
Aen. v 545 and foll. They were probably of very ancient origin,
and were taken up by the earlier Caesars because of the claims of
the Iulii to Trojan descent.

pueri nobiles: most of the authorities describe the boys taking
part in these evolutions as divided into two ‘ turmae ’ of ‘maiores ’
and ‘minores '‚ namely those under sixteen and eleven respec-
tivcly. Princes of the imperial house took part in this show at
a very {arly age: Nero was now only nine, and Britannicus six

ξ 6. dracones: so Suet. (Ner. 6) reports a story of persons sent
by Messalina to kill the child being frightened away by a serpent.

externis miraculis: such as the story that Alexander the Great
was begotten by a god in the form of a serpent.

chapter 12, § 1. supererat, ‘was a survival'. Germanicus,
son of Tiberius' brother Drusus, had died in 19 Α. D., and Nero and
his mother were the only surviving members of that family.

commotior, ‘ roused to greater fury ⁷.

quo minus, &c., ‘ was too much engrossed with . . . to make up
charges and suborn accusers '. ‘ Quo minus ’ follows the notion of
prevention in ‘ distinebatur’. For the zeugma with ‘ strueret ’ cf.
‘ molitur crimina et accusatorem ’, xii 22, 1.
