business. lt is true that some of his decisions were shrewd, and
some of the principles of law which he enunciated were after-
wards quoted with approval by juristic writers, but, attempting
to deal personally with too great a number of cases, he was often
presented with an accumulation of business, which he attempted
to meet by cutting short the full investigation of cases and making
hasty and capricious decisions. Such methods gave to those
who could catch his ear an opportunity of getting judgement in
their own favour (xi 5, 1); Claudius was easily swayed by those
around him, and they instituted a regular traffic with the parties

in the suits heard by him. A great deal of this judicial work .

was dealt with by the emperor in private, and there was no
appeal from his judgement: it became, therefore, one of the most
popular acts of Claudius' successor to promise the discontinuance
of this abuse ofjustice (xiii 4, 2).

His vanity and blindness to realities are also seen in his fond-
ness for taking military honours without having achieved any actual
military exploits. Not only did he celebrate a triumph for the con-
quest of Britain, though he was only present in the country sor
sixteen days, but he accepted the title of ‘ imperator' twenty-seven
times, for victories many of which cannot now be identified at all, and
showered triumphal distinctions broadcast upon his subordinates
for wholly insufficient reasons (xi 20, 5).

Then the fact that the main departments of administration,
comprising most of the duties that in a modern state would be
assigned to a body of civil servants under state control, were in
the hands of freedmen who were simply the emperor’s own domestic
officials, gave opportunities for intrigue and corruption within the
palace. The sreedmen began to exercise control over everything:
candidates for office applied to thern, and paid their price for
recommendation to the princeps 3 misgovernment in the provinces
might go on unchecked if the governors could get the freedmen
to connive at the plunder (xii 54; cf. also xii 45, 5; 46, 5 ; xiii 1);
and contracts for public works gave the directing freedmen other
fruitful opportunities for peculation (xii 57). The ‘avarice of the
Claudian times ’ (H. v 12, 5) became a byword.

Butthe worst abuses of Claudius’ reign arose from his timidity,
coupled with the possession of absolute power. It was easy for
