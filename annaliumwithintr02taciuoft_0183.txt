BOOK VI, CH.15‚§1—(;·11.17‚§§1--3

omissam, ‘ which had fallen into abeyance'.

ἐκ. creberrima causa: the early history os the Republic pro-
vi es many instances, and the question of debt and usury was one
os the most prominent in the struggle os plebeians against patricians.

53. duodecim tabulis: published in 449 B.C. Tacitus is our
on y authority sor assigning the law to this code. Livy ascribes it
to the tribunes Duilius and Maenius in 357 13.C.

unciario faenore: interpreted by Niebuhr and Mommsen as
8st per cent. sor the year of ten months, 10 per cent. sor twelxe
months. Others have taken it as one-twelsth per cent. per month.

agitaretur: sc. ‘faenus '.

ad semuncias: in 347 13.c. (Livy vii 27, 3).

vetit-a versura: a ‘lex Genucia’‚ ‘ne faenerare liceret ', sor-
bidding loans on interest in general, is chronicled by Livy, as passed
in 342 Β. C. ‘Versura' strictly = payment by fresh loan. This law
does not seem to have ever been formally repealed, though it was
disregarded in practice.

§4 obviam itum fraudibus: one method of evasion was to
make a ‘socius '‚ who was not bound by Roman law, the nominal
creditor3 against this a plebiscite was carried by M. Sempronius in
195 B.C., placing ‘ socii ³ and ‘Latini ' on the same footing as citizens
in this respect.

ξς. Gracchus: perhaps the same as the person mentioned in
ch. 38, 4.

tali culpa: senators themselves generally derived a great deal
of their wealth from money-lending: thus Seneca had invested
large amounts in loans in Britain (xiii 42, 7).

concedente: Intr. II 21, b.

quis, &c., ‘within which time each one was to bring his financial
arrangements into conformity with the requirements of the law ’.

Chapter 17, ξ 1. commoto, ‘ disturbed’; because creditors‚
having broken the law, had to call in their loans.

attinebatur: the supply of cash in circulation had been
diminished by its influx into the treasury‚ owing to the confiscation
of the property os the numerous persons condemned in the previous

ear.

y § 2. ad hoc. ‘to meet this difficulty ' (not, as elsewhere, ‘besides').

duas faenoris partes, ‘two-thirds of the capital lent ¹. The
object of the decree was probably to increase the demand for land,
to the advantage of debtors who had estates to sell ; but the
creditors, as the next sentence relates‚ instead of leaving one-third
still out on loan, called in the whole sum (‘ in solidum appellabant ⁵),
and as they had eighteen months in which to comply with the ‘lex '
against them, they could take their time in making the requisite
purchase of land, whereas the debtors had to realize their estates
at a time when the market was flooded with property for sale and
money was scarce.

§ 3. concursatio: men applied in vain here ancl there sor loans
or extension of time for payment.
