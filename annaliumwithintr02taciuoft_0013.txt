LIFF. OF TAClTL's

mide in merely general terms ; he speaks os ⁶ auctores ' and
‘scriptores,· or introduces a statement by ‘quidam tradidere,'
‘semim’ or ‘ tradunt‚' and the number of such expressions indicates
that the sources srom which he gathered his materials were abun-
7 dant. Not many names of the historians who dealt with the period
covered by the Annals remain, however. Of contemporary accounts
off Tiberius· times all that is extant is now contained in a few pas·
sages of Valerius Maximus, and in the closing portion of Velleius
Paterculus' history, published in 30 Α. D„ in which is a short sketch
of the first sixteen years os Tiberius’ reign. It is not knoxm if any
other histories ol Tiberius' reign were produced in his lisetime, but
soon after his death several works, now lost, carne out. There was
Tiberius’ own autobiography‚ referred to by Suetonius (Tib. 61);
there was a volume of memoirs by the younger Agrippina, giving
an account of the inner history of the court and family of Tiberius,
which probably supplied Suetonius with much of the scandal which
he repeats‚ and may have greatly influenced the historians who
preceded Tacitus, by whose time the book seems to have passed
out of circulation ; and Claudius also wrote an autobiography‚ as well
as a general history from the end of the civil wars onwards, a
voluminous work in forty-three Books. It is also known that
M. Seneca, the father of N ero's tutor, composed a history from the
beginning of the civil wars to a time shortly before his own death ε
this took place early in the reign of Gaius, so that we may conjec-
ture that his history went down to the death of Tiberius. Another
famous historian‚ osa slightly later date, was M. Servilius Nonianus,
who was consul in 35 Α. D. and died in 59 Α.1).; but it is not known what
was the period with which he dealt. More information remains as to
the work of Aufidius Bassus, who died in 60 Α. D. 3 he wrote a history
of the wars of the Romans in Germany, as well as a general history,
to which a continuation was written by the elder Pliny, and as
Pliny called this continuation a ‘ history of his own times‚’ Bassus’
work probably went to the time of Claudius. Pliny also wrote
another work in twenty Books on the wars os the Romans in
Germany, but with the exception os his Natural History his writ-
ings are lost to us.

All these would be available to Tacitus as material sor the history
contained in this volume. Later authors, to whom Tacitus refers
