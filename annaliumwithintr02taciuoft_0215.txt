which form the present‘ Porta Maggiore '. An inscription on it is ex-
tant, recording the completion and dedication os the work by Claudius
in 52 A.D., and Subsequent restorations by Vespasian and Titus. The
length of the ‘ Claudia ’ is stated by the inscription to be thirty-five,
and that of the Anio Novus sinay-two, Roman miles. Pliny says
the water was brought to a level from which all the hills of Rome
could be reached (N. ll. xxxvi 15, 24, 122). The date of the work
given by Tacitus does not agree with that in the inscription. Either
Tacitus records the inception of the work in the first year os Claudius'
censorship‚ and the inscription records its completion at the end os
his office; or, if ‘ urbi intulit ' denotes the completion of the work in
this year, 47 Α. 1)., it must be supposed that the introduction of the
Aqua Claudia into the city was first accomplished, and that the date
in the inscription records the subsequent connexion of the Anio
Novus with it.

represent ideas, which they did by means of the shapes of animals
(such primitive records of human history are to be seen engraved
on rocks), and they declare that they were the inventors of the
alphabet ¹. Tacitus ignores the fact that in the hieroglyphics other
symbols besides the forms of animals are employed. As to their
alphabet, two systems were developed‚ the ⁴ hieratic' and ‘demotic’
characters, both cursive forms into which the hieroglyphics were
modified, the former dating from the eighteenth or nineteenth
dynasty‚ and the latter from the seventh or ninth century B. C.
Another tradition, 'which Pliny ma. follows (N. H. vii 56, 57, 192),
makes Assyrian the primitive alphabet: this is derived from the
Accadian, which again was developed from hieroglyphics.

§ 2. fama est: so Hdt. v 58. Pliny ma. also gives this legend,
and says that Cadmus’ alphabet originally consisted of sixteen
letters, to which Palamedes in the time of the Trojan VVar added
four, and later Simonides of Ceos added another four. He quotes
also, on the authority of Aristotle, another tradition, making the
original number eighteen, and substituting an addition of two by
Epicharmus for that of four by Palamedes. .
