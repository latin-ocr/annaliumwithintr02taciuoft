This ⁴ ara defossa '‚ near the ⁸ meta’ of the Circus, was exposed to
view only during the ⁴ Consualia ¹, a festival held with games in the
Circus in August, said to have been instituted by Romulus and to
have been the occasion of the rape of the Sabines. The name
‘ Consus’ is probably connected with ‘ condere ⁷, denoting the god
os the stored-up harvest, and the festival was a celebration of
‘harvest-home'. The god was identified by some ancient authors
with Neptune (Poseidon Hippios), because horse-races were a
feature of the festival.

curias veteres: supply ‘ad ', from the context, and also with
⁴ forum Romanum '. The site of the ‘ curiae veteres ’‚ the original
meeting-place of the ‘curiae'‚ is not known for certain, but was
probably near the place where the arch of Constantine now stands.

sacellum Larum: generally supposed to be the ‘aedes Larum
in summa sacra via ’, built or rebuilt by Augustus (illan. Aac. iv 7),
and dedicated to the Lares ‘gemini qui compita servant ’‚ the legend
of whose birth is given in Ov. lfast. ii 599 and foll.

inde, διο. : i. e. the pomerium skirted the Forum, without includ-
ing it. The temple of Vesta, between the Palatine and Forum,
although belonging to the worship os the primitive settlement at
Rome, lay outside its original fortified limits (‘ Roma Quadrata ¹).
The Capitol was originally the citadel of the Sabines settled on
the Quirinal, and the ‘ Forum ’ a market-place between them and
the Roman inhabitants on the Palatine.

Tacitus says nothing of the line of the pomerium from the Forum
to its starting-place, probably because in ancient times the ground
over which it ran was usually inundated and so unsuitable sor ‘cippi '.

pro fortuna, ‘according to acquisitions made '.

ξ 4. publicis actis: probably means public inscriptions.

Chapter 25, ξ 1. C. Antistio M. Suillio: their full names were

55 A. D. (xiii 11, ι). The latter was son of the Suillius of xi 1, 1
and brother os the Caesoninus of xi 36, 5. From the evidence
os coinage he is known to have been proconsul of Asia under
Ves asian.

and Intr. 11 6.
