iuvenem nobilem dignitate formae, vi mentis, ac propinquo con-
sulatu, xi 28, 1; with this may be compared the brachylogical
ablative of material: moenia non saxo sed cratibus et vimentis,
xii 16, 3.

19 [3o]. The Causal Ablative is used with much sreedoin in the
Annals, where a preposition, as ‘ propter ', οι· ‘ causa’ or ‘gratia ¹ with
genitive, would be expected: regern . . . adversis proeliorum
exitiosum, vi 36, 2; continuo abscessu velut exilium obiectando,
vi 38, 2 ; amore, xi 26, 5 ; largitione aut spei magnitudine, xi 36, 25
caritate, xii 4, 3 ; desectione, xii 10, 1 ; qua necessitate, xii 46, 6.

20. Such an ablative is osten associated with an adjective
meaning famous: castellum insigne fama, xii 13, 2; egregium
vita famaque, vi 51, 5.

21 [31]. Ablative Absolute. The following uses are characteristic:

(a) the neuter ablative singular of the participle stands by
itself : multum certat0, xi 10, 3 ; nec ultra expectato quarn, xi 26, 7 ;
this often introduces a substantival clause: non distincto sua an
aliena manu (perisset), xi 38, 2 ; comperto Graecam quoque litterar
turam non simul coeptam absolutamque, xi 13, 3 ;

(b) the participle is used without any word in agreement, where
it can easily be supplied from the sense of the passage: conce-
dente (eo), vi 16, 5 ; invalido (imperatore), vi 47, 43

(c) the participle is followed by a relative, without expression of
the antecedent: additis quae ante deliquerant, vi 9, 1 ; missis qui
. . . pellicerent, xi 19, 3; excitis quorum de sententia petitus rex,
xii 12, 3.

22. It should be remembered that the ablative has the wide
general sunction of expressing the circumstances attendant on an
action. This explains

(a) the frequent occurrence of a substantive and adjective in an
ablative not definitely reserable to the categories ‘absolute‚' ‘causal,’
⁴ descriptive‚' &c., which are names for special developments of the
general function. Besides ordinary ‘ absolute ablatives,' equivalent
to a temporal clause, like caede continua, vi 29, 1, there are many
for which ‘ablative of attendant circumstance‘ would be a better
narne3 some of these approach the ‘causal' use, as certo si ab-
nueret exitio et non nulla fallendi spe, simul magnis praemiis, xi
12, 33 Chauci nulla dissensione dorni et morte Sanquinii alacres
