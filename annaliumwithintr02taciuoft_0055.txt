CLAUDIUS

os the emperor's financial agents obtained increased dignity and
power: his procurators were to have magisteria} jurisdiction in suits
affecting the fiscus, and- the emperor's procurators‚ rather than
quaestors‚ took the superintendence of the corn-ships at Ostia and
the management os the emperor's domainlands in Cisalpine Gaul
and South Italy (xii 60).

In dealing with the questions that called for settlement abroad‚
Claudius’ measures, briefly stated, were as follows. National
feeling in Judaea was conciliated by the withdrawal of the insignia
of Roman rule from the country and by the appointment of a
native prinee, Agrippa, as king over all the dominions which his
grandfather, Herod the Creat, had held under Augustus.

ln Armenia, Mithridates, originally appointed king by Tiberius,
but summoned to Rome and imprisoned by Gaius (xi 8, 1), was
restored to his kingdom, where he maintained his authority and
reasserted Armenia’s independence against Parthia. So, also,
Antiochus, taken from Commagene by Gaius, was reinstated
(xii 55, 1). Mauretania, which had been convulsed by a rising
sor national independence owing to Gaius' seizure and execution
of its king, Ptolemaeus, was subjugated by Suetonius Paulinus and
Hosidius Geta in 41 A. D.‚ and reduced to two provinces, under
procurators who were in charge of considerable military force.

In 46 Α. D. we find the kingdom of Thrace brought within the
Roman provincial system, on the death of Rhoemetalces, the king
instituted by Gaius. For many years the country had been left
under native rulers acting under Roman protection‚ but they had
not succeeded in maintaining their authority satisfactorily, and
now Thrace was put under a procurator, with 2‚000 troops,
subject to the higher authority of the legatus of Moesia. About
the same time, the provinces of Macedonia and Achaia, which since
15 Α. D. had been under the charge of the legatus of Moesia, were
restored to senatorial control.

In Gaul, Druidism was suppressed, since it was a possible
source of national insurrection, but the Romanized inhabitants
received many privileges, and their country was regarded with
special favour by Claudius as being his birthplace. In Germany,
the safety of the frontier was secured by expeditioris against the
Chatti and the Chauci, and in one os the expeditioris against the
