BOOK v, CH. G,§ 1—CH.8.§ 1

super ea. re: the subject is conjectured to be the punishment of
Livia for her complicity with Seianus in the murder of her husband
Drusus, Tiberius' son, in 23 Α. D. (iv. 3, 3 and soll.). This sentence
is a mere fragment, quite disconnected from § 2, where the con—
tinuous narrative begins with the concluding words of an address
“fade to his friends by some person unknown, attacked as a friend
o Seianus.

ξ 2. collegam: the word may refer to more than his association
with Tiberius in the consulship of 31 A.D.‚ and may imply that
latterly he had even been ‘collega imperii ’‚ filling a position com-
parable to that of Tiberius in the latter years of Augustus. [Even
in 23 A].D. Drusus complained that he was called ‘adiutor imperii ’,
ιν 7, 2.

generum : in 25 Α. 1)., Seianus had asked the emperor for
permission to marry Livia (iv 39), but the emperor's reply, while
offering promise of some connexion by marriage with the imperial
house (iv 40, 11), discouraged him from pressing his suit (iv 41, 1).

The word ‘ gener' used here in reference to Seianus indicates
that Tiberius had announced his betrothal to some member of the
imperial family ; to whom is not known.

sibi ignoscit, ‘ excuses his own error ’.

eum scelere insectantur, ‘shrink from no wickedness in attack-
ing’ ; because they accuse the innocent.

§ 3. amicum accusare: an allusion perhaps to Satrius Secundus
(vi 8, 103 47, 2), the follower and subsequent accuser of Seianus.

§ 5. per maerorem: Intr. p. xxi.

quam laeti: for the omission of ⁶ potius' see Intr. 11 47.

adiciendo: Intr. ΙΙ 22, b.

V 7 (vi 2), ξ 1. superesse, &c.‚ ‘that there was yet time to spare 7
before the end ². For ⁶ novissima’ = ‘end oflife’, cf. vi 50, 8.

ξ 2. Blaesus, uncle of Seianus, executed after his fall. He was
in charge of Pannonia at the time of the death of Augustus (iii 16, 2),
when his relaxation of discipline prompted the mutiny of the legions
there. Thanks to Seianus' influence he subsequently became
‘ extra sortem ’ proconsul of Africa in 21 A. D.‚ and gained the
‘triumphalia insignia ’‚ and the title of ‘ imperator '.

V 8 (vi 3), ᾗ 1. P. Vitellius, the uncle of the subsequent emperor, 8
is often mentioned in the earlier books of the A nnals as companion
and subordinate officer of Germanicus. He became proconsul of
Bithynia, probably in 18 A-D., and was one of the most vehement
accusers of Cn. Piso at his trial for the alleged murder of Germani-
cus in 20 Α. D.

Pomponius Secundus, a distinguished poet and tragedian of his
day, and a persona! friend of the elder Pliny.

aerarii: the ‘aerarium militare ’‚ a fund for providing soldiers
with pension on discharge, instituted in 6 A. D. by Augustus, sup-
ported chiefly by the tax ‘centesima rerum venalium'. The fund
was administered by three ⁴ praefecti ⁷ of praetorian rank.

Aelii Gaui: this is believed to be the name of the eldest son ot
