PARTHIA AND ARMENIA

PARTHIA AND ARMENIA

At the time of his assassination‚ Julius Caesar was preparing for
a great expedition against Parthia, which seems to have been
designed not only to avenge the disaster os Crassus at Carrhae in
53 B.c.‚ but also to effect a great extension of Rome’s possessions
in the East. This scheme lapsed at his death, and advantage was
taken of the unsettled state of things which ensued throughout the
Roman world by the Parthian king Orodes, who sent an army of
invasion into Syria, under his son Pacorus and the Roman exile
Labienus. Decidius Saxa, legatus of Antony in Syria, was killed,
and Syria, palestine, and most of Asia Minor were overrun by the
Parthians. This invasion seriously affected the power of Rome
in the East sor two years (41, 4ο Β. c.). But the campaigns of Ven-
tidius Bassus, in 39 and 38 P..C.‚ resulted in the recovery of the
ground thus lost: Roman prestige was restored, and in Parthia
itself there was a revolution, in which Orodes was murdered and
his throne seized by his son Phraates.

Antony at this time, by his partition of the empire with Octavian,
was in charge of the East, and was scheming to destroy the Parthian
monarchy and build up for himself a great Oriental empire in its
place. After lengthy preparations, he led a huge army of sixteen
legions, late in 36 B. C., into Media; but his invasion was a
complete failure‚ and he was in danger of utter disaster in the
course os his retreat. Nor did he improve his prospects against
Parthia by his action in Armenia in 34 Β. C., when he seized its
king Artavasdes, and took him prisoner to Alexandria on a charge
of desertion in the previous year3 for this thoroughly exasperated
the Armenians whom he should have retained as allies, filling them
with hatred and mistrust, and giving them ample grounds sor that
readiness which they showed for so long a period afterwards to
intrigue with Parthia against Rome.

Antony never actively resumed his schemes against Parthia ς his
energies were becoming impaired, and the quarrel with Octavian
was now developing. At the time of the Actian war internal
