PARTHIA AND ARMENIA

apparently soon after Actium, received Tiridates in his ssight from
Phraates, and given him a home in the province of Syria. Other
Eastern princes to whom Augustus gave asylum were the two sons ⁸
of the late king Artavasdes, brothers of Artaxias now reigning in
Armenia, whom he had found at Alexandria: these were Tigranes
and another who is conjectured to be the Artavasdes mentioned in
ii 4, 1. There was also Artavasdes the Median prince, who had
supported Tiridates against Phraates, and had for a time been held
in captivity by the latter. He escaped and fled to Augustus after
Antony’s downfall, and was set by him on the throne of Armenia
Minor. A demand was made by Phraates in 23 Β. c. that Tiridates
should be given up to him, but Augustus refused to do this, though
he sent back Phraates’ own son, who when still an infant had been
carried off by Tiridates in his flight. But in the year 20 Ρ.. c.,
Augustus visited Syria, and made with Phraates the agreement
which his panegyrists represented as a virtual conquest of Parthia.
Phraates restored the standards taken from Crassus, and became
the friend of Rome, undertaking to give no support to neighbouring
kingdoms in opposition to Rome. It was undoubtedly a triumph
for Augustus' diplomacy, and brought Rome a great increase of
prestige in Asia. Vergil and Horace celebrated the achievement
in glowing terms‚ and Augustus himself represented Parthia as
humbled and submissive ¹.

At the same time Media was given to Ariobarzanes, son of the
Median Artavasdes who had recently died at Rome. In regard to
Armenia, Augustus had meant to invade that country and exact
vengeance for the massacre of Romans perpetrated by Artaxias at
the time of his accession, but no invasion in force proved neces-
sary, as Artaxias was murdered by his relatives (ii 3, 3), and his
brother Tigranes was accepted as king, and was instituted in his
kingdom by Tiberius. This was represented by Augustus as
equivalent to the capture of the country: coins bear the legend
‘ Armenia Capta' or ‘ Recepta,' and he stated that though he might
