INTRODUCTION

previous marriage to become the supplanter of Claudius’ own
child Britannicus. There was a party in the Senate opposed to
her, as is witnessed by the attacks on her partisans, unsuccessful
in the case of Vitellius (xii 42), but successful in another, that of
Tarquitius Priscus (xii 59); and in the freedman Narcissus she
had a deadly enemy, who finally organized an intrigue for her
destruction and the restoration of Britannicus to the prospect of
succession. But she had so secured her position that she was able
to prevent this intrigue from coming to effect: she hastened the
emperor’s death, procured her son's accession, and soon afterwards
compelled Narcissus to commit suicide.

lt will be noticed that the best features of Claudius’ administra-
tion are shown in the early part of his reign. Then, it would
seem, his powers were at their best, and the ministers who co-
operated with him aimed at producing a good impression by
efficient administration. Neither can the fulsome eulogy¹ nor the
scathing denunciation ² of Seneca be accepted as affording the true
portrait of Claudius. The satire has undoubtedly much influenced
the accounts of subsequent historians, but when allowance has been
made for the satirist’s extravagance, there remains a sufficiency of
concrete facts to render such an account as we have from Tacitus
credible enough. There are acts of senseless extravagance (xii 56),
the neglect to attend to the standing need of provisioning the city
(xii 43), failure to control misgovernment in the provinces (xii 54)
and gross abuse of justice (xi 1—3‘). Such are the evils that natur-
ally arise under an absolute ruler whose character is in decay:
that of Claudius, we may conclude, had broken down within a
few years after his succession, as the routine of administration
wearied him and unrestrained sensuality exhausted his powers.

for Nero's amusement.
